NAME
       ecocrumb - Process target directories, convert PDFs to plaintext,
       generate topics_features.json and parsed_sections.json

SYNOPSIS
       ecocrumb [--force] [--batch] [--train] <target_directory> [num_topics]

DESCRIPTION
       The ecocrumb script is a utility for processing target directories,
       converting PDFs to plaintext files, and generating topics_features.json
       and parsed_sections.json files. It provides options to force
       regeneration of files, batch process multiple folders, and run the
       generate_topics.sh script.

OPTIONS
       --force
              Forces regeneration of the topics_features.json and
              parsed_sections.json files, even if they already exist.

       --batch
              Processes each folder within the target_directory separately.

       --train
              Enables the generation of topics_features.json using the
              generate_topics.sh script.

ARGUMENTS
       <target_directory>
              The directory or path to the target directory to be processed.

       [num_topics]
              The number of topics to generate. Default value: 15.

       Note:   The square brackets [] indicate optional arguments.

EXAMPLES
       1. Process a single target directory:
          $ ecocrumb target_dir

       2. Process a target directory with a specific number of topics:
          $ ecocrumb target_dir 10

       3. Force regeneration and process a target directory:
          $ ecocrumb --force target_dir

       4. Batch process multiple folders within a target directory:
          $ ecocrumb --batch target_dir

       5. Enable training mode and process a target directory:
          $ ecocrumb --train target_dir

NOTES
       - The script requires the esgetlpipeline scripts to be present in the
         same directory as the ecocrumb script.

       - The output directories 'topics_features' and 'parsed_sections' will
         be created within the target_directory.

       - The 'plaintext' directory will be created within the target_directory
         to store converted plaintext files.

       - The 'results/' and 'esg_LanguageModel/src/' directories will be
         created within the directory where the ecocrumb script is located,
         and the parsed_sections files will be copied to those directories.
