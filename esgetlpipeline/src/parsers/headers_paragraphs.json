  "Our Approach": "Message from our ESG Senior DirectorAs I took the reins of Posts ESG program this year, there were three main objectives to focus upon:1.   We follow through on our goals and commitments. Last year we stated six environmental goals and commitments, and I am proud to share we have made progress on all of them. See Goals and Commitments, on next page.This ESG report provides an exciting opportunity toreflect on our accomplishments over the past year andthe forward journey with our ESG program. Advancing ourprogram over the past year has not been an easy endeavor.Like all consumer packaged goods companies, we facedchallenges across our value chain while navigating diverseand continuously evolving ESG expectations from ourconstituents. I can confidently say we have persevered andour ESG program is helping make our company an even betterplace to work, partner with and invest in.2.   Our key investors and customers are comfortable withthe direction of our ESG program and performance.We have significantly enhanced our disclosures, includinglaunching a new Responsibility section on our website, moreproactively managing our investor rating profiles and activelyparticipating in customer sustainability initiatives.3.   ESG is integrated into our organization. This objectiverepresents the holy grail of corporate ESG and defining aprogram that is business as usual. We are pursuing thisobjective in two ways: 1) standardization of practices andprocesses across the enterprise, with a focus in the pastyear on environmental accounting, internal ESG Guidelines,and supplier qualification, assurance and traceability; and2) collaborating with key functions. See ESG Integration,on next page.This report has been designed in a unique manner andintentionally laid out to be easily deconstructed with the varioussections readily available for other uses beyond sharing anannual update.We hope you enjoy reading our latest ESG report and learningmore about Post Holdings and our businesses. While we areenergized by the progress of our ESG program, we know this isonly the end of the beginning and there are many opportunitiesin front of us to ensure we operate responsibly and meet ourpromises to our constituents.Nick MartinSenior Director, ESGGoals and CommitmentsOverviewFiscal Year 2022 ProgressReduce our greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 30% by 2030 in our direct operations(Scope 1 and Scope 2) and develop a supply chain GHG goal (Scope 3) over the next 12 months Weetabix transitioned to purchasing 100% renewable electricity Evaluating solar projects at multiple manufacturing and office locations Disclosed additional details on our data and GHG management, including a more robustdisclosure to CDP Climate Disclosed a Scope 3 GHG emissions baselineAdopt a no deforestation policy within our supply chain covering key commodities Published a No Deforestation Policy, focused on palm oil, soy, beef and pulp and paperAssess our water impact, particularly in high-stress environments Completed a water stress assessment for our global production, warehouse anddistribution sites finding less than 5% of sites are high-stress locationsAssess our waste to landfill Shared learnings enterprise-wide from Weetabix being zero waste to landfill since 2016and from individual landfill free sites within our portfolio Launched an initiative with procurement department to proactively manage expiringwaste contracts with a focus on optimizing waste reuse and recyclingParticipate in the Sustainable PackagingCoalition and implement How2Recyclelabeling across our productsJoined the Sustainable Packaging Coalition at the enterprise levelDeveloped an ESG Guideline for use of How2Recycle labels across our products with Post Consumer Brands having planned implementation for over 85% of packagingTwo businesses have committed to 100% recyclability of all packaging by 2025Continue enhancing and evolving our animal welfare policies and ensuring our suppliers areaccountable to our policiesMaintained our Animal Welfare Committee with recognized third-party experts         Continued our partnership with a leading advisory partner to enhance and evolve ourpolicies and practicesESG IntegrationFunctionRepresentative Examples During Fiscal Year 2022LegalJoint monitoring of emerging ESG-related regulations,such as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)proposed rules for climate-related disclosuresProcurementSteering Committee and Working Group participation in theSupplier Qualification and Assurance InitiativeCommunicationsPublication of ESG and Diversity, Equity and Inclusion(DEI) NewslettersInternal AuditBuilding capacity to identify linkages and proactivelyprepare for emerging assurance requirementsEthics and ComplianceProviding inputs into our updated Global Code of Conduct,supplier due diligence and corporate policiesInformation TechnologyPiloting a leading-edge ESG platform called EcocrumbMarketing, Sales and Customer ManagementResponding to ESG-related surveys, inquiries and partnership opportunitiesHuman ResourcesIntegrating ESG into recruitment and employee engagement processesOur ApproachPosts approach to ESGis based upon a strategicframework, which provides ourorganization with a structuredand focused method foradvancing our ESG program.ESG Strategic FrameworkSocial ResponsibilityDiversity, Equity and InclusionEmpowering PeopleCommunity EngagementSourcing ResponsibilitySupplier ESG PracticesCommodity TraceabilityAnimal WelfareProduct ResponsibilityFood Quality and SafetySustainable PackagingResponsible MarketingOperational ResponsibilityEHS&S Data and KPIsClimate and EnergyEnvironmental StewardshipESG OversightEthics and ComplianceInternal ControlsTransparencyOur promised to our constituentsColleaguesCustomersConsumersCommunityCapital ProvidersComponent 1 Our Promise to ConstituentsUnderstanding the perspectives of a wide range ofstakeholders is critical to identifying and managing ourESG priorities.

While we havesome centralized functions (such as procurement, tax, SECreporting and corporate compliance) and shared functions(such as food safety), our businesses have autonomousmanagement teams and drive their own strategies for growth.While Post acknowledges the need for enterprise-widecommitments and a culture of responsibility, we use a strategicbusiness-by-business approach to optimize attention andresources for greatest impact and business value. Each companyis empowered to drive its ESG and sustainability efforts basedupon what is most material to its unique business, productsand stakeholders. There are a variety of ESG-focused projectstaking place across our enterprise at any given time, but not allare identical. One business may be focused on further enhancinganimal welfare practices, while another where that topic is notrelevant may be more focused on sustainable packaging. This isa strength of being a holding company, allowing our organizationto be more agile and responsive to the unique opportunitiesthat an ESG focus provides. Consistent across our businessesis a commitment to being a responsible company and the ESGoversight structure as described to the right.OversightBoard of DirectorsAudit Committee of the Board of DirectorsLeadershipExecutive ManagementInvestor Relations DirectorESG Senior DirectorStrategyESG Steering CommitteeESG Operations CouncilIntegrationPost Consumer BrandsFoodservice and Refrigerated RetailWeetabix8th Avenue Food & ProvisionsBoard of DirectorsPost Holdings Board of Directors (the Board) is a strong, balancedblend of current and retired executives whose exceptionalknowledge and considerable experience strategically guide andsupport the delivery of long-term value to the company.

To meet thesedemands, we believe it is essential to be proactive with indirectcommunications (e.g., website content, our annual ESG Reportand social media) as well as direct engagements such as routinemeetings we hold with key investors and customers to specificallyunderstand their perspectives on our ESG program and theirorganizations ESG priorities.Post strives to align with leading and emerging standards forcorporate ESG reporting and disclosure, such as the GlobalReporting Initiative (GRI), Corporate Sustainability ReportingDirective (CSRD), the Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation(SFDR) and the International Sustainability Standards Board(ISSB).

Post committedto implementing How2Recycle (H2R) labels across our portfolio ofbrands and products and in 2022 developed an internal guidelineto help accelerate efforts across all businesses. H2R is the nextgeneration recycling label that helps inform consumers how todispose of or recycle packaging accurately and where to go if theyneed to find information specific to their municipality.In the U.K., our Weetabix business ran a campaign withsustainability influencer Dougie Poynter to encourage our drinkslovers to recycle their bottles and will be rolling out consumercommunications across social media accounts to remind everyoneto do their part.How2Recycle Labeling System Im excited about wherewe are today, as well aswhere we are headed onour packaging sustainabilityjourney. Our core strategies,which encompass quality,supply assurance and totalcost are all aligned with oursustainability goals.Dave BrownSenior Vice President, Chief Procurement Officer,Post Holdings85%Our Post Consumer Brands business has defined H2Rlabels for 85% of branded products.Packaging InnovationDuring fiscal year 2022, our Post Consumer Brands businessannounced a new commitment to design for 100% recyclablecereal and product packaging across its product base by 2025.The business is currently at 90% recyclable packaging due toa focus for several years on reducing the amount of packagingnecessary for our products. For example, we reduced plasticfilm usage in cereal bags by more than one million pounds whilemaintaining overall durability and quality. The year before, thePost Consumer Brands team reduced paper packaging materialusage by about 930,000 pounds. The packaging research anddevelopment teams are working to identify solutions to furtherclose the gap.Low-impact packaging is one of four strategic pillars of ourWeetabix Change for Better sustainability strategy. The focusis on reducing the overall impact of our packaging, which meanstaking a holistic view of all packaging choices and ensuring thatthey reduce waste and reduce emissions.Weetabix achieved 100% recyclability for all packaging, believingthis is the best option for its food-grade packaging. This wasachieved by successful changes, such as: Shifting to 100% recyclable bottles and reducing plastic by 10%for the Weetabix On The Go drinks range. Introducing an innovative new wrap for Weetabix, which is 100%recyclable in curbside collections.Many packaging innovations we are pursuing also result in carbonreductions. For example, the above two achievements alsoreduced our carbon footprint, removing 9% from our drinks rangeand 20% from Weetabix packaging.Food preservation also must remain front of mind in all ourpackaging decisions as food waste is arguably a bigger threatto the environment than packaging waste, with a bigger carbonfootprint. While there are plastic-free options available, many ofthem dont keep our food fresh resulting in food waste and anincrease in carbon footprint compared to our existing packaging.Last year, Weetabix developed a model that predicts the effect ofdifferent materials on food waste, and it has been successful inhelping select materials to trial. We remain committed to doing allthe due diligence to find the best environmental solutions to keepthe impact of our packaging low. Were working all the timeto optimize the materials weuse in our packaging so thatwe achieve the best balance ofproduct protection and lowestimpact. This helps makeprogress on the sustainabilityfront, but it also ensuresour business operates asefficiently as we can.Mark TyrrellWeetabix Packaging Development ManagerRESPONSIBLE MARKETINGPost produces a wide portfolio of products that meet a varietyof consumer needs including value, taste, availability, nutritionand sustainability.

President and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) serves on the Board of Directors and is frequently and directly engaged with our Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) Steering Committee, which oversees climate-related issues. Our President and CEO is regularly briefed on ESG and sustainability topics and progress by our ESG Senior Director and our ESG Steering Committee. Given carbon and climate change are an important topic for our key customers and investors, this topic is consistently included in briefings. TheThe ESG Steering Committee, which is led by our ESG Senior Director, includes leaders from global procurement, communications, legal, investor relations, and operations and reports directly to our Executive Vice President, General Counsel and Chief Administrative Officer.The ESG Steering Committee provides information and recommendations to the full Board of Directors, including climate-related risks and opportunities, at scheduled meetings and as important issues arise. As stated in our Corporate Governance Guidelines, The Board shall oversee matters relating to the Companys environmental, social and governance (ESG) practices and initiatives, as well as other social issues important to the Companysconstituents. The Board shall review the Companys annual or periodic ESG reports and consider significant ESG trends that may impact the Company. In addition, the Board Audit Committee Charter includes review information concerning environmental, legal, regulatory and other matters that may represent material financial exposure and/or material risk and appropriate management thereof. The ESG Steering Committee also routinely engages with the Presidents/CEOs from each of our operating companies.StrategyDisclose the actual and potential impacts of climate-related risks and opportunities on theorganizations businesses, strategy, and financial planning, including: a) Describe the climate related risks and opportunities the organization has identified over the short, medium and long term; b) Describe the impact of climate-related risks and opportunities on the organizations businesses, strategy and financial planning; and c) Describe the resilience of the organizations strategy, taking into consideration different climate-related scenarios, including a 2C or lower scenario.CDP Climate Change Questionnaire 2021 References: C2.1a, C2.3, C2.3a, C2.4, C2.4a, C3.2, C3.2a, C3.2b, C3.3, and C3.4Post maintains a TCFD-aligned global risk and opportunity assessment process that evaluates the relevancy of acute physical, chronic physical and transition and market risks and opportunities for our direct operations and supply chain. Our process for evaluating and monitoring climate-related risks and opportunities considers the following time horizons: short-term (0-2 years); medium-term (2-5 years); and long-term (5-10 years).For our baseline global assessment, we considered four distinct scenarios based upon a combination of physical and transition risks and the dynamics of average global warming degrees as described on page 28 of our 2022 ESG Report.The four scenarios are based upon a combination of physical and transition risks and the dynamics of average global warming degrees. If global temperatures go above 2C, the physical climate risks can be expected to be more frequent and intense. Conversely, if rapid decarbonization occurs through policies, regulations, innovation and consumer demand, then global temperatures will plateau or start to decrease, physical risks will lessen, and transition risks will become more dominant. It is also assumed that transition risks take a longer period forimplementation and impact, which results in scenarios that have medium- to long-term business implications.Additionally, it is expected scenario conditions will not be global and will vary by geography and time horizon (e.g., some geographies will accelerate decarbonization efforts faster than others). Posts approach is to evaluate the current and future relevance of these scenarios and monitoring changing conditions (e.g., a location moving from one scenario to a different one).Climate-related risks and opportunities are relevant to a consumer packaged goods companys entire value chain from raw material sourcing to the end of life or circularity for a given product. The impacts of physical and transition factors can influence our strategies, processes and decisions and can have both positive and potentially negative financial impacts. Our approach to climate adaptation and resiliency is based upon evaluating the following TCFD-defined opportunity categories as relevant to our company: Resource Efficiency: Pursuing more efficient raw material sourcing, production and transport. Energy Sourcing: Pursuing lower emission or renewable sources of energy. Products and Services: Responding to shifts in consumer preferences towards low carbon goods and services. Markets: Ability to access new and emerging markets due to more effective climate adaptation. Resilience: Pursuing enhanced business resiliency and ability to operate through various conditions and climate scenarios.From a climate risk perspective, over 75% of our production sites and approximately 90% of warehouse and distribution sites are exposed to a preferable scenario of low physical and low transition and market risks. Projecting into the future and the climate resiliency of our organization, it is possible that more of our production sites could be exposed to increased policy and market regulations and small number of sites could transition into a scenario of both higher physical and higher transition and market risks. Post Holdings is in the process of further evaluating our raw material sourcing from direct and indirect suppliers following a similar four-scenario method. Based upon our production sites being in Canada, the United States and the United Kingdom, we expected that the risk profile of our raw material sourcing will be like that of our production and warehouse portfolios.ManagementDisclose how the organization identifies, assesses, and manages climate-related risks, including: a) Describe the organizations processes for identifying and assessing climate-related risks; b) Describe the organizations processes for managing climate-related risks; and c) Describe how processes for identifying, assessing and managing climate-related risks are integrated into the organizations overall risk management.CDP Climate Change Questionnaire 2021 References: C2.1, C2.1a, C2.2, and C2.2aPosts process for evaluating acute physical, chronic physical, and transition risks and opportunities uses location specific inputs from widely recognized, publicly available data sources and risk categories including the following:Data Sources World Resources Institute (WRI) Aqueduct WWF Water Risk Filter Department of Homeland Security FEMA National Risk Index Alliance for Zero Extinction Conservation International Biodiversity Hotspot Key Biodiversity Area (KBA) Partnership Energy Information Administration (EIA) Energy & Climate Intelligence Unit (ECIU) Net Zero Scorecard United Nations Framework Convention onClimate Change (UNFCC) Nationally DeterminedContributions (NDC) Registry Location-specific contextual data from varioussources (e.g., energy mix, utility renewableenergy targets, net metering status and carbonpricing mechanisms)Risk Categories Extreme weather (avalanches/winter weather/cold waves, earthquakes, hail, hurricanes, icestorms, landslides, lightning, strong winds/tornadoes, tsunamis, volcanic activity andwildfires) Inland/riverine floods Water stress (availability and quality) Drought / Heat waves Coastal floods / Sea level rise Biodiversity and sensitive habitats Transition and marketThere are three main components to Posts strategy for managing climate-related risks and opportunities:1) Decarbonization: Post is committed to a 30% reduction in our GHG emissions within direct operations, Scope 1 and 2, by 2030. In fiscal year 2022, Post developed our Scope 3 GHG emissions baseline using the spend-based method. Post remains committed to reducing Scope 3 emissions and setting a goal but has delayed public announcement pending relevant climate-related regulations expected to be finalized in early 2023. In preparation for setting a goal, we utilized our baseline Scope 3 emissions profile to benchmark the GHG programs of our key suppliers and goal options. Our Weetabix business continues to explore Science Based Targets and will set new 2030 targets in 2023 with an ambition of operating as a net zero business by 2050.2) Climate Resiliency: The Post Risk Management function oversees a comprehensive program to evaluate and mitigate risks to our business, assets and people including consideration of climate-related risks and resiliency. The program includes periodic internal and external, by our commercial insurance partner, assessments risk exposure and preparedness. This insight is utilized to prioritize further evaluations, develop or enhance business continuity plans, and where necessary implement insurance mechanisms.3) Transparency: Post is committed to disclosing our plans and progress related to climate risks and opportunities, including participation in the annual CDP Climate questionnaire, an annual ESG Report, maintaining information on our website and this TCFD index.Metrics and TargetsDisclose the metrics and targets used to assess and manage relevant climate-related risks andopportunities, including: a) Disclose the metrics used by the organization to assess climate-related risks and opportunities in line with its strategy and risk management process; b) Disclose Scope 1, Scope 2 and, if appropriate, Scope 3 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and the related risks; and c) Describe the targets used by the organization to manage climate-related risks and opportunities and performance against targets.CDP Climate Change Questionnaire 2021 References: C4.1, C4.1a, C5 (all), C6.1, C6.3, C6.5, C7 (all), and C8 (all)Post has a culture of continuous improvement, which includes utilizing metrics and targets to evaluate and drive performance. We are also committed to transparency with updated metrics, targets and progress within our annual ESG Report and on our website at: www.postholdings.com/responsibility.",

Sustainable PackagingOur focus is on supporting eachbusiness to advance sustainablepackaging, including activeparticipation in the SustainablePackaging Coalition, implementingHow2Recycle labels acrossproducts and outlining forward looking roadmaps.3. Responsible MarketingOur focus is on continuousenhancement of our processes toensure our products are responsiblymarketed.FOOD QUALITY AND SAFETYFood Safety Management SystemsWe verify the effective implementation of food safety managementsystems at our manufacturing and warehousing facilities throughthe use of internal and third-party audits. Third-party auditorsassess our company-owned and co-manufacturer facilities alikeagainst international standards such as SQF, BRC and FSSC22000,which have been approved by the Global Food Safety Initiative(GFSI). GFSI is a global organization for benchmarking andharmonizing of food safety auditing and certifications standards.For our supplier facilities, we implement risk-based qualitymanagement programs whereby external assessments areevaluated against the GFSI approved standards.We have processes in place to quickly identify and communicatefood safety risks and drive timely risk management, including,where necessary, recall measures. Our ingredients, packagingmaterials, finished products and critical controls are traced,enabling us to investigate and address any potential concerns inthe marketplace. Our internal food safety assurance systems areable to continuously monitor for errors during production. Thesesystems position Post to proactively withdraw affected products ina timely manner and in compliance with all applicable regulations.In fiscal year 2022, the Post businesses had one product recallrelated to mislabeling of a small quantity of product.Continuous ImprovementWe are committed to continuously improving our food safetymanagement systems.

Post committedto implementing How2Recycle (H2R) labels across our portfolio ofbrands and products and in 2022 developed an internal guidelineto help accelerate efforts across all businesses. H2R is the nextgeneration recycling label that helps inform consumers how todispose of or recycle packaging accurately and where to go if theyneed to find information specific to their municipality.In the U.K., our Weetabix business ran a campaign withsustainability influencer Dougie Poynter to encourage our drinkslovers to recycle their bottles and will be rolling out consumercommunications across social media accounts to remind everyoneto do their part.How2Recycle Labeling System Im excited about wherewe are today, as well aswhere we are headed onour packaging sustainabilityjourney. Our core strategies,which encompass quality,supply assurance and totalcost are all aligned with oursustainability goals.Dave BrownSenior Vice President, Chief Procurement Officer,Post Holdings85%Our Post Consumer Brands business has defined H2Rlabels for 85% of branded products.Packaging InnovationDuring fiscal year 2022, our Post Consumer Brands businessannounced a new commitment to design for 100% recyclablecereal and product packaging across its product base by 2025.The business is currently at 90% recyclable packaging due toa focus for several years on reducing the amount of packagingnecessary for our products. For example, we reduced plasticfilm usage in cereal bags by more than one million pounds whilemaintaining overall durability and quality. The year before, thePost Consumer Brands team reduced paper packaging materialusage by about 930,000 pounds. The packaging research anddevelopment teams are working to identify solutions to furtherclose the gap.Low-impact packaging is one of four strategic pillars of ourWeetabix Change for Better sustainability strategy. The focusis on reducing the overall impact of our packaging, which meanstaking a holistic view of all packaging choices and ensuring thatthey reduce waste and reduce emissions.Weetabix achieved 100% recyclability for all packaging, believingthis is the best option for its food-grade packaging. This wasachieved by successful changes, such as: Shifting to 100% recyclable bottles and reducing plastic by 10%for the Weetabix On The Go drinks range. Introducing an innovative new wrap for Weetabix, which is 100%recyclable in curbside collections.Many packaging innovations we are pursuing also result in carbonreductions. For example, the above two achievements alsoreduced our carbon footprint, removing 9% from our drinks rangeand 20% from Weetabix packaging.Food preservation also must remain front of mind in all ourpackaging decisions as food waste is arguably a bigger threatto the environment than packaging waste, with a bigger carbonfootprint. While there are plastic-free options available, many ofthem dont keep our food fresh resulting in food waste and anincrease in carbon footprint compared to our existing packaging.Last year, Weetabix developed a model that predicts the effect ofdifferent materials on food waste, and it has been successful inhelping select materials to trial. We remain committed to doing allthe due diligence to find the best environmental solutions to keepthe impact of our packaging low. Were working all the timeto optimize the materials weuse in our packaging so thatwe achieve the best balance ofproduct protection and lowestimpact.

MentalThirst, hunger,anxiety, fear, painand distressLOGISTICS AND TRANSPORTATIONWe recognize the environmental impacts related to transportingraw materials and products and are proactively working toidentify ways to increase efficiency in our value chain withoutcompromising quality or customer satisfaction.Each of our businesses has unique distribution networks basedupon sourcing, production and product distribution to high-volumefood distributors, retailers, club stores, supercenters, massmerchandisers and national restaurant chains.Our logistics and transportation network is made up of three maincomponents:1. Private fleets owned by Post2. Third-party services managed by Post3. Third-party services managed by suppliers or customersThe majority of our logistics and transportation is through thirdparty service providers.Private Fleets Owned by PostOur Foodservice and Refrigerated Retail businesses own andoperate their own fleets and two transportation facilities. Thisallows for more control, better distribution and transportationpractices and an opportunity to minimize environmental impactsof transport. The vehicles have modern technology that allowsfor increased energy efficiency and enhanced safety. For calendaryear 2021, the private fleet statistics were:Fuel Gallons2,185,747MTCO222,317Third-Party Services Managed by PostThe third-party logistics and transportation service providersmanaged by Post use a combination of intermodal, truckload,less-than-truckload (LTL) and international shipments via afreight forwarder. Post partners with a strategic transportationmanagement solutions provider that provides our team withanalytics and insights to manage costs, improve transportationnetwork efficiency and minimize fuel use and GHG emissions.Within each contract renewal, Post stipulates a miles per gallon(MPG) range to realize these benefits. For fiscal year 2022, we hadthe following statistics for intermodal and truckload and will workto include LTL and international shipments in 2023 reporting:Fuel Gallons - Intermodal15,582,711Fuel Gallons - Truckload1,612,300MTCO2177,567Post Consumer Brands participates in the United States Environmental Protection Agencys (EPA) SmartWay Shipper Program (SmartWay). SmartWay helps companies advance supplychain sustainability through efficient transportation and advancedfuel-saving technologies. As part of this voluntary public-privatepartnership, Post Consumer Brands shares fuel use and freightemissions information with the EPA. The agency then helpsidentify opportunities to reduce environmental risk and emissionsand pursue more efficient freight carriers and supply chainoperational strategies.Third-Party Services Managed by Suppliers or CustomersThe third component of our logistics and transportation networkincludes inbound raw materials and services managed bysuppliers and also customers that pick up and take rightsto outbound products from our facilities, distribution andwarehouse sites.Distributing clean energyIn 2021, Post partnered with Taylor Truck Lines to purchase the state ofMinnesotas first electric terminal tractor with funding from the MinnesotaPollution Control Agency.

Sustainable PackagingOur focus is on supporting eachbusiness to advance sustainablepackaging, including activeparticipation in the SustainablePackaging Coalition, implementingHow2Recycle labels acrossproducts and outlining forward looking roadmaps.3. Responsible MarketingOur focus is on continuousenhancement of our processes toensure our products are responsiblymarketed.FOOD QUALITY AND SAFETYFood Safety Management SystemsWe verify the effective implementation of food safety managementsystems at our manufacturing and warehousing facilities throughthe use of internal and third-party audits. Third-party auditorsassess our company-owned and co-manufacturer facilities alikeagainst international standards such as SQF, BRC and FSSC22000,which have been approved by the Global Food Safety Initiative(GFSI). GFSI is a global organization for benchmarking andharmonizing of food safety auditing and certifications standards.For our supplier facilities, we implement risk-based qualitymanagement programs whereby external assessments areevaluated against the GFSI approved standards.We have processes in place to quickly identify and communicatefood safety risks and drive timely risk management, including,where necessary, recall measures. Our ingredients, packagingmaterials, finished products and critical controls are traced,enabling us to investigate and address any potential concerns inthe marketplace. Our internal food safety assurance systems areable to continuously monitor for errors during production. Thesesystems position Post to proactively withdraw affected products ina timely manner and in compliance with all applicable regulations.In fiscal year 2022, the Post businesses had one product recallrelated to mislabeling of a small quantity of product.Continuous ImprovementWe are committed to continuously improving our food safetymanagement systems. We define, track and report on metrics forsafety of products and robustness of our preventive controls. Weset targets and invest resources in our facilities to drive continuousimprovement in those metrics and our food safety managementsystems.

Weetabix followsthe aims of WRAPs UK Plastics Pack and joined as a member inthe past year.Consumer EngagementWhile we are committed to continuously improving our packaging,it is important to ensure consumers have the necessaryinformation to do their part to optimize recycling. Post committedto implementing How2Recycle (H2R) labels across our portfolio ofbrands and products and in 2022 developed an internal guidelineto help accelerate efforts across all businesses. H2R is the nextgeneration recycling label that helps inform consumers how todispose of or recycle packaging accurately and where to go if theyneed to find information specific to their municipality.In the U.K., our Weetabix business ran a campaign withsustainability influencer Dougie Poynter to encourage our drinkslovers to recycle their bottles and will be rolling out consumercommunications across social media accounts to remind everyoneto do their part.How2Recycle Labeling System Im excited about wherewe are today, as well aswhere we are headed onour packaging sustainabilityjourney. Our core strategies,which encompass quality,supply assurance and totalcost are all aligned with oursustainability goals.Dave BrownSenior Vice President, Chief Procurement Officer,Post Holdings85%Our Post Consumer Brands business has defined H2Rlabels for 85% of branded products.Packaging InnovationDuring fiscal year 2022, our Post Consumer Brands businessannounced a new commitment to design for 100% recyclablecereal and product packaging across its product base by 2025.The business is currently at 90% recyclable packaging due toa focus for several years on reducing the amount of packagingnecessary for our products. For example, we reduced plasticfilm usage in cereal bags by more than one million pounds whilemaintaining overall durability and quality. The year before, thePost Consumer Brands team reduced paper packaging materialusage by about 930,000 pounds. The packaging research anddevelopment teams are working to identify solutions to furtherclose the gap.Low-impact packaging is one of four strategic pillars of ourWeetabix Change for Better sustainability strategy. The focusis on reducing the overall impact of our packaging, which meanstaking a holistic view of all packaging choices and ensuring thatthey reduce waste and reduce emissions.Weetabix achieved 100% recyclability for all packaging, believingthis is the best option for its food-grade packaging. This wasachieved by successful changes, such as: Shifting to 100% recyclable bottles and reducing plastic by 10%for the Weetabix On The Go drinks range. Introducing an innovative new wrap for Weetabix, which is 100%recyclable in curbside collections.Many packaging innovations we are pursuing also result in carbonreductions. For example, the above two achievements alsoreduced our carbon footprint, removing 9% from our drinks rangeand 20% from Weetabix packaging.Food preservation also must remain front of mind in all ourpackaging decisions as food waste is arguably a bigger threatto the environment than packaging waste, with a bigger carbonfootprint. While there are plastic-free options available, many ofthem dont keep our food fresh resulting in food waste and anincrease in carbon footprint compared to our existing packaging.Last year, Weetabix developed a model that predicts the effect ofdifferent materials on food waste, and it has been successful inhelping select materials to trial. We remain committed to doing allthe due diligence to find the best environmental solutions to keepthe impact of our packaging low. Were working all the timeto optimize the materials weuse in our packaging so thatwe achieve the best balance ofproduct protection and lowestimpact. This helps makeprogress on the sustainabilityfront, but it also ensuresour business operates asefficiently as we can.Mark TyrrellWeetabix Packaging Development ManagerRESPONSIBLE MARKETINGPost produces a wide portfolio of products that meet a varietyof consumer needs including value, taste, availability, nutritionand sustainability.

Weetabix followsthe aims of WRAPs UK Plastics Pack and joined as a member inthe past year.Consumer EngagementWhile we are committed to continuously improving our packaging,it is important to ensure consumers have the necessaryinformation to do their part to optimize recycling. Post committedto implementing How2Recycle (H2R) labels across our portfolio ofbrands and products and in 2022 developed an internal guidelineto help accelerate efforts across all businesses. H2R is the nextgeneration recycling label that helps inform consumers how todispose of or recycle packaging accurately and where to go if theyneed to find information specific to their municipality.In the U.K., our Weetabix business ran a campaign withsustainability influencer Dougie Poynter to encourage our drinkslovers to recycle their bottles and will be rolling out consumercommunications across social media accounts to remind everyoneto do their part.How2Recycle Labeling System Im excited about wherewe are today, as well aswhere we are headed onour packaging sustainabilityjourney. Our core strategies,which encompass quality,supply assurance and totalcost are all aligned with oursustainability goals.Dave BrownSenior Vice President, Chief Procurement Officer,Post Holdings85%Our Post Consumer Brands business has defined H2Rlabels for 85% of branded products.Packaging InnovationDuring fiscal year 2022, our Post Consumer Brands businessannounced a new commitment to design for 100% recyclablecereal and product packaging across its product base by 2025.The business is currently at 90% recyclable packaging due toa focus for several years on reducing the amount of packagingnecessary for our products. For example, we reduced plasticfilm usage in cereal bags by more than one million pounds whilemaintaining overall durability and quality. The year before, thePost Consumer Brands team reduced paper packaging materialusage by about 930,000 pounds. The packaging research anddevelopment teams are working to identify solutions to furtherclose the gap.Low-impact packaging is one of four strategic pillars of ourWeetabix Change for Better sustainability strategy. The focusis on reducing the overall impact of our packaging, which meanstaking a holistic view of all packaging choices and ensuring thatthey reduce waste and reduce emissions.Weetabix achieved 100% recyclability for all packaging, believingthis is the best option for its food-grade packaging. This wasachieved by successful changes, such as: Shifting to 100% recyclable bottles and reducing plastic by 10%for the Weetabix On The Go drinks range. Introducing an innovative new wrap for Weetabix, which is 100%recyclable in curbside collections.Many packaging innovations we are pursuing also result in carbonreductions. For example, the above two achievements alsoreduced our carbon footprint, removing 9% from our drinks rangeand 20% from Weetabix packaging.Food preservation also must remain front of mind in all ourpackaging decisions as food waste is arguably a bigger threatto the environment than packaging waste, with a bigger carbonfootprint. While there are plastic-free options available, many ofthem dont keep our food fresh resulting in food waste and anincrease in carbon footprint compared to our existing packaging.Last year, Weetabix developed a model that predicts the effect ofdifferent materials on food waste, and it has been successful inhelping select materials to trial. We remain committed to doing allthe due diligence to find the best environmental solutions to keepthe impact of our packaging low. Were working all the timeto optimize the materials weuse in our packaging so thatwe achieve the best balance ofproduct protection and lowestimpact. This helps makeprogress on the sustainabilityfront, but it also ensuresour business operates asefficiently as we can.Mark TyrrellWeetabix Packaging Development ManagerRESPONSIBLE MARKETINGPost produces a wide portfolio of products that meet a varietyof consumer needs including value, taste, availability, nutritionand sustainability.

For additionaldetails, please reference responses in ourCDP 2022 Climate Change Questionnaireavailable at www.cdp.net.GovernanceDisclose the organizations governance around climate-related risks and opportunities, including: a) Describe the boards oversight of climate-related risks and opportunities; and b) Describe managements role in assessing and managing climate-related risks and opportunities.CDP Climate Change Questionnaire 2021 References: C1.1a, C1.1b, C1.2, and C1.2aPost Holdings, Inc. President and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) serves on the Board of Directors and is frequently and directly engaged with our Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) Steering Committee, which oversees climate-related issues. Our President and CEO is regularly briefed on ESG and sustainability topics and progress by our ESG Senior Director and our ESG Steering Committee. Given carbon and climate change are an important topic for our key customers and investors, this topic is consistently included in briefings. TheThe ESG Steering Committee, which is led by our ESG Senior Director, includes leaders from global procurement, communications, legal, investor relations, and operations and reports directly to our Executive Vice President, General Counsel and Chief Administrative Officer.The ESG Steering Committee provides information and recommendations to the full Board of Directors, including climate-related risks and opportunities, at scheduled meetings and as important issues arise. As stated in our Corporate Governance Guidelines, The Board shall oversee matters relating to the Companys environmental, social and governance (ESG) practices and initiatives, as well as other social issues important to the Companysconstituents. The Board shall review the Companys annual or periodic ESG reports and consider significant ESG trends that may impact the Company. In addition, the Board Audit Committee Charter includes review information concerning environmental, legal, regulatory and other matters that may represent material financial exposure and/or material risk and appropriate management thereof. The ESG Steering Committee also routinely engages with the Presidents/CEOs from each of our operating companies.StrategyDisclose the actual and potential impacts of climate-related risks and opportunities on theorganizations businesses, strategy, and financial planning, including: a) Describe the climate related risks and opportunities the organization has identified over the short, medium and long term; b) Describe the impact of climate-related risks and opportunities on the organizations businesses, strategy and financial planning; and c) Describe the resilience of the organizations strategy, taking into consideration different climate-related scenarios, including a 2C or lower scenario.CDP Climate Change Questionnaire 2021 References: C2.1a, C2.3, C2.3a, C2.4, C2.4a, C3.2, C3.2a, C3.2b, C3.3, and C3.4Post maintains a TCFD-aligned global risk and opportunity assessment process that evaluates the relevancy of acute physical, chronic physical and transition and market risks and opportunities for our direct operations and supply chain. Our process for evaluating and monitoring climate-related risks and opportunities considers the following time horizons: short-term (0-2 years); medium-term (2-5 years); and long-term (5-10 years).For our baseline global assessment, we considered four distinct scenarios based upon a combination of physical and transition risks and the dynamics of average global warming degrees as described on page 28 of our 2022 ESG Report.The four scenarios are based upon a combination of physical and transition risks and the dynamics of average global warming degrees. If global temperatures go above 2C, the physical climate risks can be expected to be more frequent and intense. Conversely, if rapid decarbonization occurs through policies, regulations, innovation and consumer demand, then global temperatures will plateau or start to decrease, physical risks will lessen, and transition risks will become more dominant. It is also assumed that transition risks take a longer period forimplementation and impact, which results in scenarios that have medium- to long-term business implications.Additionally, it is expected scenario conditions will not be global and will vary by geography and time horizon (e.g., some geographies will accelerate decarbonization efforts faster than others). Posts approach is to evaluate the current and future relevance of these scenarios and monitoring changing conditions (e.g., a location moving from one scenario to a different one).Climate-related risks and opportunities are relevant to a consumer packaged goods companys entire value chain from raw material sourcing to the end of life or circularity for a given product. The impacts of physical and transition factors can influence our strategies, processes and decisions and can have both positive and potentially negative financial impacts. Our approach to climate adaptation and resiliency is based upon evaluating the following TCFD-defined opportunity categories as relevant to our company: Resource Efficiency: Pursuing more efficient raw material sourcing, production and transport. Energy Sourcing: Pursuing lower emission or renewable sources of energy. Products and Services: Responding to shifts in consumer preferences towards low carbon goods and services. Markets: Ability to access new and emerging markets due to more effective climate adaptation. Resilience: Pursuing enhanced business resiliency and ability to operate through various conditions and climate scenarios.From a climate risk perspective, over 75% of our production sites and approximately 90% of warehouse and distribution sites are exposed to a preferable scenario of low physical and low transition and market risks. Projecting into the future and the climate resiliency of our organization, it is possible that more of our production sites could be exposed to increased policy and market regulations and small number of sites could transition into a scenario of both higher physical and higher transition and market risks. Post Holdings is in the process of further evaluating our raw material sourcing from direct and indirect suppliers following a similar four-scenario method. Based upon our production sites being in Canada, the United States and the United Kingdom, we expected that the risk profile of our raw material sourcing will be like that of our production and warehouse portfolios.ManagementDisclose how the organization identifies, assesses, and manages climate-related risks, including: a) Describe the organizations processes for identifying and assessing climate-related risks; b) Describe the organizations processes for managing climate-related risks; and c) Describe how processes for identifying, assessing and managing climate-related risks are integrated into the organizations overall risk management.CDP Climate Change Questionnaire 2021 References: C2.1, C2.1a, C2.2, and C2.2aPosts process for evaluating acute physical, chronic physical, and transition risks and opportunities uses location specific inputs from widely recognized, publicly available data sources and risk categories including the following:Data Sources World Resources Institute (WRI) Aqueduct WWF Water Risk Filter Department of Homeland Security FEMA National Risk Index Alliance for Zero Extinction Conservation International Biodiversity Hotspot Key Biodiversity Area (KBA) Partnership Energy Information Administration (EIA) Energy & Climate Intelligence Unit (ECIU) Net Zero Scorecard United Nations Framework Convention onClimate Change (UNFCC) Nationally DeterminedContributions (NDC) Registry Location-specific contextual data from varioussources (e.g., energy mix, utility renewableenergy targets, net metering status and carbonpricing mechanisms)Risk Categories Extreme weather (avalanches/winter weather/cold waves, earthquakes, hail, hurricanes, icestorms, landslides, lightning, strong winds/tornadoes, tsunamis, volcanic activity andwildfires) Inland/riverine floods Water stress (availability and quality) Drought / Heat waves Coastal floods / Sea level rise Biodiversity and sensitive habitats Transition and marketThere are three main components to Posts strategy for managing climate-related risks and opportunities:1) Decarbonization: Post is committed to a 30% reduction in our GHG emissions within direct operations, Scope 1 and 2, by 2030. In fiscal year 2022, Post developed our Scope 3 GHG emissions baseline using the spend-based method. Post remains committed to reducing Scope 3 emissions and setting a goal but has delayed public announcement pending relevant climate-related regulations expected to be finalized in early 2023. In preparation for setting a goal, we utilized our baseline Scope 3 emissions profile to benchmark the GHG programs of our key suppliers and goal options. Our Weetabix business continues to explore Science Based Targets and will set new 2030 targets in 2023 with an ambition of operating as a net zero business by 2050.2) Climate Resiliency: The Post Risk Management function oversees a comprehensive program to evaluate and mitigate risks to our business, assets and people including consideration of climate-related risks and resiliency. The program includes periodic internal and external, by our commercial insurance partner, assessments risk exposure and preparedness. This insight is utilized to prioritize further evaluations, develop or enhance business continuity plans, and where necessary implement insurance mechanisms.3) Transparency: Post is committed to disclosing our plans and progress related to climate risks and opportunities, including participation in the annual CDP Climate questionnaire, an annual ESG Report, maintaining information on our website and this TCFD index.Metrics and TargetsDisclose the metrics and targets used to assess and manage relevant climate-related risks andopportunities, including: a) Disclose the metrics used by the organization to assess climate-related risks and opportunities in line with its strategy and risk management process; b) Disclose Scope 1, Scope 2 and, if appropriate, Scope 3 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and the related risks; and c) Describe the targets used by the organization to manage climate-related risks and opportunities and performance against targets.CDP Climate Change Questionnaire 2021 References: C4.1, C4.1a, C5 (all), C6.1, C6.3, C6.5, C7 (all), and C8 (all)Post has a culture of continuous improvement, which includes utilizing metrics and targets to evaluate and drive performance.

Post committedto implementing How2Recycle (H2R) labels across our portfolio ofbrands and products and in 2022 developed an internal guidelineto help accelerate efforts across all businesses. H2R is the nextgeneration recycling label that helps inform consumers how todispose of or recycle packaging accurately and where to go if theyneed to find information specific to their municipality.In the U.K., our Weetabix business ran a campaign withsustainability influencer Dougie Poynter to encourage our drinkslovers to recycle their bottles and will be rolling out consumercommunications across social media accounts to remind everyoneto do their part.How2Recycle Labeling System Im excited about wherewe are today, as well aswhere we are headed onour packaging sustainabilityjourney. Our core strategies,which encompass quality,supply assurance and totalcost are all aligned with oursustainability goals.Dave BrownSenior Vice President, Chief Procurement Officer,Post Holdings85%Our Post Consumer Brands business has defined H2Rlabels for 85% of branded products.Packaging InnovationDuring fiscal year 2022, our Post Consumer Brands businessannounced a new commitment to design for 100% recyclablecereal and product packaging across its product base by 2025.The business is currently at 90% recyclable packaging due toa focus for several years on reducing the amount of packagingnecessary for our products. For example, we reduced plasticfilm usage in cereal bags by more than one million pounds whilemaintaining overall durability and quality. The year before, thePost Consumer Brands team reduced paper packaging materialusage by about 930,000 pounds. The packaging research anddevelopment teams are working to identify solutions to furtherclose the gap.Low-impact packaging is one of four strategic pillars of ourWeetabix Change for Better sustainability strategy. The focusis on reducing the overall impact of our packaging, which meanstaking a holistic view of all packaging choices and ensuring thatthey reduce waste and reduce emissions.Weetabix achieved 100% recyclability for all packaging, believingthis is the best option for its food-grade packaging. This wasachieved by successful changes, such as: Shifting to 100% recyclable bottles and reducing plastic by 10%for the Weetabix On The Go drinks range. Introducing an innovative new wrap for Weetabix, which is 100%recyclable in curbside collections.Many packaging innovations we are pursuing also result in carbonreductions. For example, the above two achievements alsoreduced our carbon footprint, removing 9% from our drinks rangeand 20% from Weetabix packaging.Food preservation also must remain front of mind in all ourpackaging decisions as food waste is arguably a bigger threatto the environment than packaging waste, with a bigger carbonfootprint. While there are plastic-free options available, many ofthem dont keep our food fresh resulting in food waste and anincrease in carbon footprint compared to our existing packaging.Last year, Weetabix developed a model that predicts the effect ofdifferent materials on food waste, and it has been successful inhelping select materials to trial. We remain committed to doing allthe due diligence to find the best environmental solutions to keepthe impact of our packaging low. Were working all the timeto optimize the materials weuse in our packaging so thatwe achieve the best balance ofproduct protection and lowestimpact.

President and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) serves on the Board of Directors and is frequently and directly engaged with our Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) Steering Committee, which oversees climate-related issues. Our President and CEO is regularly briefed on ESG and sustainability topics and progress by our ESG Senior Director and our ESG Steering Committee. Given carbon and climate change are an important topic for our key customers and investors, this topic is consistently included in briefings. TheThe ESG Steering Committee, which is led by our ESG Senior Director, includes leaders from global procurement, communications, legal, investor relations, and operations and reports directly to our Executive Vice President, General Counsel and Chief Administrative Officer.The ESG Steering Committee provides information and recommendations to the full Board of Directors, including climate-related risks and opportunities, at scheduled meetings and as important issues arise. As stated in our Corporate Governance Guidelines, The Board shall oversee matters relating to the Companys environmental, social and governance (ESG) practices and initiatives, as well as other social issues important to the Companysconstituents. The Board shall review the Companys annual or periodic ESG reports and consider significant ESG trends that may impact the Company. In addition, the Board Audit Committee Charter includes review information concerning environmental, legal, regulatory and other matters that may represent material financial exposure and/or material risk and appropriate management thereof. The ESG Steering Committee also routinely engages with the Presidents/CEOs from each of our operating companies.StrategyDisclose the actual and potential impacts of climate-related risks and opportunities on theorganizations businesses, strategy, and financial planning, including: a) Describe the climate related risks and opportunities the organization has identified over the short, medium and long term; b) Describe the impact of climate-related risks and opportunities on the organizations businesses, strategy and financial planning; and c) Describe the resilience of the organizations strategy, taking into consideration different climate-related scenarios, including a 2C or lower scenario.CDP Climate Change Questionnaire 2021 References: C2.1a, C2.3, C2.3a, C2.4, C2.4a, C3.2, C3.2a, C3.2b, C3.3, and C3.4Post maintains a TCFD-aligned global risk and opportunity assessment process that evaluates the relevancy of acute physical, chronic physical and transition and market risks and opportunities for our direct operations and supply chain. Our process for evaluating and monitoring climate-related risks and opportunities considers the following time horizons: short-term (0-2 years); medium-term (2-5 years); and long-term (5-10 years).For our baseline global assessment, we considered four distinct scenarios based upon a combination of physical and transition risks and the dynamics of average global warming degrees as described on page 28 of our 2022 ESG Report.The four scenarios are based upon a combination of physical and transition risks and the dynamics of average global warming degrees. If global temperatures go above 2C, the physical climate risks can be expected to be more frequent and intense. Conversely, if rapid decarbonization occurs through policies, regulations, innovation and consumer demand, then global temperatures will plateau or start to decrease, physical risks will lessen, and transition risks will become more dominant. It is also assumed that transition risks take a longer period forimplementation and impact, which results in scenarios that have medium- to long-term business implications.Additionally, it is expected scenario conditions will not be global and will vary by geography and time horizon (e.g., some geographies will accelerate decarbonization efforts faster than others). Posts approach is to evaluate the current and future relevance of these scenarios and monitoring changing conditions (e.g., a location moving from one scenario to a different one).Climate-related risks and opportunities are relevant to a consumer packaged goods companys entire value chain from raw material sourcing to the end of life or circularity for a given product. The impacts of physical and transition factors can influence our strategies, processes and decisions and can have both positive and potentially negative financial impacts. Our approach to climate adaptation and resiliency is based upon evaluating the following TCFD-defined opportunity categories as relevant to our company: Resource Efficiency: Pursuing more efficient raw material sourcing, production and transport. Energy Sourcing: Pursuing lower emission or renewable sources of energy. Products and Services: Responding to shifts in consumer preferences towards low carbon goods and services. Markets: Ability to access new and emerging markets due to more effective climate adaptation. Resilience: Pursuing enhanced business resiliency and ability to operate through various conditions and climate scenarios.From a climate risk perspective, over 75% of our production sites and approximately 90% of warehouse and distribution sites are exposed to a preferable scenario of low physical and low transition and market risks. Projecting into the future and the climate resiliency of our organization, it is possible that more of our production sites could be exposed to increased policy and market regulations and small number of sites could transition into a scenario of both higher physical and higher transition and market risks. Post Holdings is in the process of further evaluating our raw material sourcing from direct and indirect suppliers following a similar four-scenario method. Based upon our production sites being in Canada, the United States and the United Kingdom, we expected that the risk profile of our raw material sourcing will be like that of our production and warehouse portfolios.ManagementDisclose how the organization identifies, assesses, and manages climate-related risks, including: a) Describe the organizations processes for identifying and assessing climate-related risks; b) Describe the organizations processes for managing climate-related risks; and c) Describe how processes for identifying, assessing and managing climate-related risks are integrated into the organizations overall risk management.CDP Climate Change Questionnaire 2021 References: C2.1, C2.1a, C2.2, and C2.2aPosts process for evaluating acute physical, chronic physical, and transition risks and opportunities uses location specific inputs from widely recognized, publicly available data sources and risk categories including the following:Data Sources World Resources Institute (WRI) Aqueduct WWF Water Risk Filter Department of Homeland Security FEMA National Risk Index Alliance for Zero Extinction Conservation International Biodiversity Hotspot Key Biodiversity Area (KBA) Partnership Energy Information Administration (EIA) Energy & Climate Intelligence Unit (ECIU) Net Zero Scorecard United Nations Framework Convention onClimate Change (UNFCC) Nationally DeterminedContributions (NDC) Registry Location-specific contextual data from varioussources (e.g., energy mix, utility renewableenergy targets, net metering status and carbonpricing mechanisms)Risk Categories Extreme weather (avalanches/winter weather/cold waves, earthquakes, hail, hurricanes, icestorms, landslides, lightning, strong winds/tornadoes, tsunamis, volcanic activity andwildfires) Inland/riverine floods Water stress (availability and quality) Drought / Heat waves Coastal floods / Sea level rise Biodiversity and sensitive habitats Transition and marketThere are three main components to Posts strategy for managing climate-related risks and opportunities:1) Decarbonization: Post is committed to a 30% reduction in our GHG emissions within direct operations, Scope 1 and 2, by 2030. In fiscal year 2022, Post developed our Scope 3 GHG emissions baseline using the spend-based method. Post remains committed to reducing Scope 3 emissions and setting a goal but has delayed public announcement pending relevant climate-related regulations expected to be finalized in early 2023. In preparation for setting a goal, we utilized our baseline Scope 3 emissions profile to benchmark the GHG programs of our key suppliers and goal options. Our Weetabix business continues to explore Science Based Targets and will set new 2030 targets in 2023 with an ambition of operating as a net zero business by 2050.2) Climate Resiliency: The Post Risk Management function oversees a comprehensive program to evaluate and mitigate risks to our business, assets and people including consideration of climate-related risks and resiliency. The program includes periodic internal and external, by our commercial insurance partner, assessments risk exposure and preparedness. This insight is utilized to prioritize further evaluations, develop or enhance business continuity plans, and where necessary implement insurance mechanisms.3) Transparency: Post is committed to disclosing our plans and progress related to climate risks and opportunities, including participation in the annual CDP Climate questionnaire, an annual ESG Report, maintaining information on our website and this TCFD index.Metrics and TargetsDisclose the metrics and targets used to assess and manage relevant climate-related risks andopportunities, including: a) Disclose the metrics used by the organization to assess climate-related risks and opportunities in line with its strategy and risk management process; b) Disclose Scope 1, Scope 2 and, if appropriate, Scope 3 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and the related risks; and c) Describe the targets used by the organization to manage climate-related risks and opportunities and performance against targets.CDP Climate Change Questionnaire 2021 References: C4.1, C4.1a, C5 (all), C6.1, C6.3, C6.5, C7 (all), and C8 (all)Post has a culture of continuous improvement, which includes utilizing metrics and targets to evaluate and drive performance.

SPC membership also exposes us to new ideas,allows us to network with other leadership companies and offerspotential collaboration opportunities with SPC. Weetabix followsthe aims of WRAPs UK Plastics Pack and joined as a member inthe past year.Consumer EngagementWhile we are committed to continuously improving our packaging,it is important to ensure consumers have the necessaryinformation to do their part to optimize recycling. Post committedto implementing How2Recycle (H2R) labels across our portfolio ofbrands and products and in 2022 developed an internal guidelineto help accelerate efforts across all businesses. H2R is the nextgeneration recycling label that helps inform consumers how todispose of or recycle packaging accurately and where to go if theyneed to find information specific to their municipality.In the U.K., our Weetabix business ran a campaign withsustainability influencer Dougie Poynter to encourage our drinkslovers to recycle their bottles and will be rolling out consumercommunications across social media accounts to remind everyoneto do their part.How2Recycle Labeling System Im excited about wherewe are today, as well aswhere we are headed onour packaging sustainabilityjourney. Our core strategies,which encompass quality,supply assurance and totalcost are all aligned with oursustainability goals.Dave BrownSenior Vice President, Chief Procurement Officer,Post Holdings85%Our Post Consumer Brands business has defined H2Rlabels for 85% of branded products.Packaging InnovationDuring fiscal year 2022, our Post Consumer Brands businessannounced a new commitment to design for 100% recyclablecereal and product packaging across its product base by 2025.The business is currently at 90% recyclable packaging due toa focus for several years on reducing the amount of packagingnecessary for our products. For example, we reduced plasticfilm usage in cereal bags by more than one million pounds whilemaintaining overall durability and quality. The year before, thePost Consumer Brands team reduced paper packaging materialusage by about 930,000 pounds. The packaging research anddevelopment teams are working to identify solutions to furtherclose the gap.Low-impact packaging is one of four strategic pillars of ourWeetabix Change for Better sustainability strategy. The focusis on reducing the overall impact of our packaging, which meanstaking a holistic view of all packaging choices and ensuring thatthey reduce waste and reduce emissions.Weetabix achieved 100% recyclability for all packaging, believingthis is the best option for its food-grade packaging. This wasachieved by successful changes, such as: Shifting to 100% recyclable bottles and reducing plastic by 10%for the Weetabix On The Go drinks range. Introducing an innovative new wrap for Weetabix, which is 100%recyclable in curbside collections.Many packaging innovations we are pursuing also result in carbonreductions. For example, the above two achievements alsoreduced our carbon footprint, removing 9% from our drinks rangeand 20% from Weetabix packaging.Food preservation also must remain front of mind in all ourpackaging decisions as food waste is arguably a bigger threatto the environment than packaging waste, with a bigger carbonfootprint. While there are plastic-free options available, many ofthem dont keep our food fresh resulting in food waste and anincrease in carbon footprint compared to our existing packaging.Last year, Weetabix developed a model that predicts the effect ofdifferent materials on food waste, and it has been successful inhelping select materials to trial. We remain committed to doing allthe due diligence to find the best environmental solutions to keepthe impact of our packaging low. Were working all the timeto optimize the materials weuse in our packaging so thatwe achieve the best balance ofproduct protection and lowestimpact. This helps makeprogress on the sustainabilityfront, but it also ensuresour business operates asefficiently as we can.Mark TyrrellWeetabix Packaging Development ManagerRESPONSIBLE MARKETINGPost produces a wide portfolio of products that meet a varietyof consumer needs including value, taste, availability, nutritionand sustainability.

Our wastewater dischargevolume for fiscal year 2022 was 1,769 million gallons.Our Next Steps: Post will use the results of our global water riskassessment, combined with our water and wastewater data, toinform decisions on further assessment, actions and investments.A priority focus will be placed on sites located in high water stressgeographies to confirm sound water stewardship practices andconsider watershed engagement opportunities.WASTE MINIMIZATIONWaste minimization, recycling and reuse is of the utmostimportance to our business, the environment and society. Toreduce waste to landfill, we continuously work to identify andimplement best practices throughout our enterprise to eliminatewaste and optimize material recycling and reuse.Our Commitment: Assess our waste to landfill across theenterprise.Our Progress in Fiscal Year 2022: In the past year, Post wasfocused on understanding and validating our baseline wastegeneration, streams and diversion from landfill. Post has achievedan overall diversion from landfill rate of 90% for all non-hazardouswaste generated that was recycled or reused. This has beenachieved due to our Weetabix business maintaining zero wasteto landfill since 2016, our Michael Foods business diverting over93% of waste materials from landfills due to recycle, reuseand repurpose efforts and our Post Consumer Brands businessachieving a 96% landfill diversion rate.In fiscal year 2022, Post generated 866.7 million pounds ofnon-hazardous waste with 90% of this waste able to be divertedfrom landfills through recycling or reuse. Compared to our fiscalyear 2020 baseline, Post has reduced total non-hazardous wastegeneration by 12.5%.Our Next Steps: As waste service contracts are renewed atsites, we are working to eliminate wastes and optimize reuse andrecycling. We will also continue to drive best practice sharingacross our enterprise to further pursue our commitment toreducing waste to landfill.Non-Hazardous Waste and Landfill Diversion (million pounds and percent diversion from landfill)YearWaste DisposedWaste RecycledLandfill DiversionFY202087.8902.384%FY202177.4911.292%FY202287.5779.290%Waste RecycledLandfill Diversion (%)Post Consumer Brands Commits to Designing for 100%Recyclable Cereal Packaging by 2025Post Consumer Brands believes that one way to make the world abetter place is by continuously improving packaging so it uses fewermaterials and is easier for consumers to recycle. Over the past fewyears, the research and development team focused on reducing theamount of packaging needed for our products, including reducingplastic film usage in our cereal bags by more than one millionpounds. The team accomplished this by decreasing the thicknessof the bags in most Post and Malt-O-Meal cereal products, whilestill maintaining their overall durability and quality. Plastic isnt theonly packaging material were working to reduce our usage of.Last year, we reduced paper packaging material usage by about930,000 pounds.Early in 2022, the team shifted their focus to recyclability, and PostConsumer Brands committed to designing for 100% recyclablecereal and product packaging by 2025. Currently, about 90% ofthe packaging materials, by weight, that Post Consumer Brandsuses in manufacturing plants are made from recycled content orrenewable resources and can be recycled by consumers.CHEP Pallet ProgramWe are proud to work with CHEP, a trusted partner and global leader in sustainably movinggoods. CHEP has a share and reuse pallet program that helps bring several efficiencies andenvironmental benefits to our sites in comparison with one-way, single-use solutions.

  "Consumer Engagement": "While we are committed to continuously improving our packaging,it is important to ensure consumers have the necessaryinformation to do their part to optimize recycling. Post committedto implementing How2Recycle (H2R) labels across our portfolio ofbrands and products and in 2022 developed an internal guidelineto help accelerate efforts across all businesses. H2R is the nextgeneration recycling label that helps inform consumers how todispose of or recycle packaging accurately and where to go if theyneed to find information specific to their municipality.In the U.K., our Weetabix business ran a campaign withsustainability influencer Dougie Poynter to encourage our drinkslovers to recycle their bottles and will be rolling out consumercommunications across social media accounts to remind everyoneto do their part.",

  "Packaging Innovation": "During fiscal year 2022, our Post Consumer Brands businessannounced a new commitment to design for 100% recyclablecereal and product packaging across its product base by 2025.The business is currently at 90% recyclable packaging due toa focus for several years on reducing the amount of packagingnecessary for our products. For example, we reduced plasticfilm usage in cereal bags by more than one million pounds whilemaintaining overall durability and quality. The year before, thePost Consumer Brands team reduced paper packaging materialusage by about 930,000 pounds. The packaging research anddevelopment teams are working to identify solutions to furtherclose the gap.Low-impact packaging is one of four strategic pillars of ourWeetabix Change for Better sustainability strategy. The focusis on reducing the overall impact of our packaging, which meanstaking a holistic view of all packaging choices and ensuring thatthey reduce waste and reduce emissions.Weetabix achieved 100% recyclability for all packaging, believingthis is the best option for its food-grade packaging. This wasachieved by successful changes, such as: Shifting to 100% recyclable bottles and reducing plastic by 10%for the Weetabix On The Go drinks range. Introducing an innovative new wrap for Weetabix, which is 100%recyclable in curbside collections.Many packaging innovations we are pursuing also result in carbonreductions. For example, the above two achievements alsoreduced our carbon footprint, removing 9% from our drinks rangeand 20% from Weetabix packaging.Food preservation also must remain front of mind in all ourpackaging decisions as food waste is arguably a bigger threatto the environment than packaging waste, with a bigger carbonfootprint. While there are plastic-free options available, many ofthem dont keep our food fresh resulting in food waste and anincrease in carbon footprint compared to our existing packaging.Last year, Weetabix developed a model that predicts the effect ofdifferent materials on food waste, and it has been successful inhelping select materials to trial. We remain committed to doing allthe due diligence to find the best environmental solutions to keepthe impact of our packaging low. Were working all the timeto optimize the materials weuse in our packaging so thatwe achieve the best balance ofproduct protection and lowestimpact. This helps makeprogress on the sustainabilityfront, but it also ensuresour business operates asefficiently as we can.Mark TyrrellWeetabix Packaging Development Manager",

Sustainable PackagingOur focus is on supporting eachbusiness to advance sustainablepackaging, including activeparticipation in the SustainablePackaging Coalition, implementingHow2Recycle labels acrossproducts and outlining forward looking roadmaps.3. Responsible MarketingOur focus is on continuousenhancement of our processes toensure our products are responsiblymarketed.FOOD QUALITY AND SAFETYFood Safety Management SystemsWe verify the effective implementation of food safety managementsystems at our manufacturing and warehousing facilities throughthe use of internal and third-party audits. Third-party auditorsassess our company-owned and co-manufacturer facilities alikeagainst international standards such as SQF, BRC and FSSC22000,which have been approved by the Global Food Safety Initiative(GFSI). GFSI is a global organization for benchmarking andharmonizing of food safety auditing and certifications standards.For our supplier facilities, we implement risk-based qualitymanagement programs whereby external assessments areevaluated against the GFSI approved standards.We have processes in place to quickly identify and communicatefood safety risks and drive timely risk management, including,where necessary, recall measures. Our ingredients, packagingmaterials, finished products and critical controls are traced,enabling us to investigate and address any potential concerns inthe marketplace. Our internal food safety assurance systems areable to continuously monitor for errors during production. Thesesystems position Post to proactively withdraw affected products ina timely manner and in compliance with all applicable regulations.In fiscal year 2022, the Post businesses had one product recallrelated to mislabeling of a small quantity of product.Continuous ImprovementWe are committed to continuously improving our food safetymanagement systems. We define, track and report on metrics forsafety of products and robustness of our preventive controls. Weset targets and invest resources in our facilities to drive continuousimprovement in those metrics and our food safety managementsystems.

SPC membership also exposes us to new ideas,allows us to network with other leadership companies and offerspotential collaboration opportunities with SPC. Weetabix followsthe aims of WRAPs UK Plastics Pack and joined as a member inthe past year.Consumer EngagementWhile we are committed to continuously improving our packaging,it is important to ensure consumers have the necessaryinformation to do their part to optimize recycling. Post committedto implementing How2Recycle (H2R) labels across our portfolio ofbrands and products and in 2022 developed an internal guidelineto help accelerate efforts across all businesses. H2R is the nextgeneration recycling label that helps inform consumers how todispose of or recycle packaging accurately and where to go if theyneed to find information specific to their municipality.In the U.K., our Weetabix business ran a campaign withsustainability influencer Dougie Poynter to encourage our drinkslovers to recycle their bottles and will be rolling out consumercommunications across social media accounts to remind everyoneto do their part.How2Recycle Labeling System Im excited about wherewe are today, as well aswhere we are headed onour packaging sustainabilityjourney. Our core strategies,which encompass quality,supply assurance and totalcost are all aligned with oursustainability goals.Dave BrownSenior Vice President, Chief Procurement Officer,Post Holdings85%Our Post Consumer Brands business has defined H2Rlabels for 85% of branded products.Packaging InnovationDuring fiscal year 2022, our Post Consumer Brands businessannounced a new commitment to design for 100% recyclablecereal and product packaging across its product base by 2025.The business is currently at 90% recyclable packaging due toa focus for several years on reducing the amount of packagingnecessary for our products. For example, we reduced plasticfilm usage in cereal bags by more than one million pounds whilemaintaining overall durability and quality. The year before, thePost Consumer Brands team reduced paper packaging materialusage by about 930,000 pounds. The packaging research anddevelopment teams are working to identify solutions to furtherclose the gap.Low-impact packaging is one of four strategic pillars of ourWeetabix Change for Better sustainability strategy. The focusis on reducing the overall impact of our packaging, which meanstaking a holistic view of all packaging choices and ensuring thatthey reduce waste and reduce emissions.Weetabix achieved 100% recyclability for all packaging, believingthis is the best option for its food-grade packaging. This wasachieved by successful changes, such as: Shifting to 100% recyclable bottles and reducing plastic by 10%for the Weetabix On The Go drinks range. Introducing an innovative new wrap for Weetabix, which is 100%recyclable in curbside collections.Many packaging innovations we are pursuing also result in carbonreductions. For example, the above two achievements alsoreduced our carbon footprint, removing 9% from our drinks rangeand 20% from Weetabix packaging.Food preservation also must remain front of mind in all ourpackaging decisions as food waste is arguably a bigger threatto the environment than packaging waste, with a bigger carbonfootprint. While there are plastic-free options available, many ofthem dont keep our food fresh resulting in food waste and anincrease in carbon footprint compared to our existing packaging.Last year, Weetabix developed a model that predicts the effect ofdifferent materials on food waste, and it has been successful inhelping select materials to trial. We remain committed to doing allthe due diligence to find the best environmental solutions to keepthe impact of our packaging low. Were working all the timeto optimize the materials weuse in our packaging so thatwe achieve the best balance ofproduct protection and lowestimpact. This helps makeprogress on the sustainabilityfront, but it also ensuresour business operates asefficiently as we can.Mark TyrrellWeetabix Packaging Development ManagerRESPONSIBLE MARKETINGPost produces a wide portfolio of products that meet a varietyof consumer needs including value, taste, availability, nutritionand sustainability.

Post committedto implementing How2Recycle (H2R) labels across our portfolio ofbrands and products and in 2022 developed an internal guidelineto help accelerate efforts across all businesses. H2R is the nextgeneration recycling label that helps inform consumers how todispose of or recycle packaging accurately and where to go if theyneed to find information specific to their municipality.In the U.K., our Weetabix business ran a campaign withsustainability influencer Dougie Poynter to encourage our drinkslovers to recycle their bottles and will be rolling out consumercommunications across social media accounts to remind everyoneto do their part.How2Recycle Labeling System Im excited about wherewe are today, as well aswhere we are headed onour packaging sustainabilityjourney. Our core strategies,which encompass quality,supply assurance and totalcost are all aligned with oursustainability goals.Dave BrownSenior Vice President, Chief Procurement Officer,Post Holdings85%Our Post Consumer Brands business has defined H2Rlabels for 85% of branded products.Packaging InnovationDuring fiscal year 2022, our Post Consumer Brands businessannounced a new commitment to design for 100% recyclablecereal and product packaging across its product base by 2025.The business is currently at 90% recyclable packaging due toa focus for several years on reducing the amount of packagingnecessary for our products. For example, we reduced plasticfilm usage in cereal bags by more than one million pounds whilemaintaining overall durability and quality. The year before, thePost Consumer Brands team reduced paper packaging materialusage by about 930,000 pounds. The packaging research anddevelopment teams are working to identify solutions to furtherclose the gap.Low-impact packaging is one of four strategic pillars of ourWeetabix Change for Better sustainability strategy. The focusis on reducing the overall impact of our packaging, which meanstaking a holistic view of all packaging choices and ensuring thatthey reduce waste and reduce emissions.Weetabix achieved 100% recyclability for all packaging, believingthis is the best option for its food-grade packaging. This wasachieved by successful changes, such as: Shifting to 100% recyclable bottles and reducing plastic by 10%for the Weetabix On The Go drinks range. Introducing an innovative new wrap for Weetabix, which is 100%recyclable in curbside collections.Many packaging innovations we are pursuing also result in carbonreductions. For example, the above two achievements alsoreduced our carbon footprint, removing 9% from our drinks rangeand 20% from Weetabix packaging.Food preservation also must remain front of mind in all ourpackaging decisions as food waste is arguably a bigger threatto the environment than packaging waste, with a bigger carbonfootprint. While there are plastic-free options available, many ofthem dont keep our food fresh resulting in food waste and anincrease in carbon footprint compared to our existing packaging.Last year, Weetabix developed a model that predicts the effect ofdifferent materials on food waste, and it has been successful inhelping select materials to trial. We remain committed to doing allthe due diligence to find the best environmental solutions to keepthe impact of our packaging low. Were working all the timeto optimize the materials weuse in our packaging so thatwe achieve the best balance ofproduct protection and lowestimpact. This helps makeprogress on the sustainabilityfront, but it also ensuresour business operates asefficiently as we can.Mark TyrrellWeetabix Packaging Development ManagerRESPONSIBLE MARKETINGPost produces a wide portfolio of products that meet a varietyof consumer needs including value, taste, availability, nutritionand sustainability.

For additionaldetails, please reference responses in ourCDP 2022 Climate Change Questionnaireavailable at www.cdp.net.GovernanceDisclose the organizations governance around climate-related risks and opportunities, including: a) Describe the boards oversight of climate-related risks and opportunities; and b) Describe managements role in assessing and managing climate-related risks and opportunities.CDP Climate Change Questionnaire 2021 References: C1.1a, C1.1b, C1.2, and C1.2aPost Holdings, Inc. President and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) serves on the Board of Directors and is frequently and directly engaged with our Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) Steering Committee, which oversees climate-related issues. Our President and CEO is regularly briefed on ESG and sustainability topics and progress by our ESG Senior Director and our ESG Steering Committee. Given carbon and climate change are an important topic for our key customers and investors, this topic is consistently included in briefings. TheThe ESG Steering Committee, which is led by our ESG Senior Director, includes leaders from global procurement, communications, legal, investor relations, and operations and reports directly to our Executive Vice President, General Counsel and Chief Administrative Officer.The ESG Steering Committee provides information and recommendations to the full Board of Directors, including climate-related risks and opportunities, at scheduled meetings and as important issues arise. As stated in our Corporate Governance Guidelines, The Board shall oversee matters relating to the Companys environmental, social and governance (ESG) practices and initiatives, as well as other social issues important to the Companysconstituents. The Board shall review the Companys annual or periodic ESG reports and consider significant ESG trends that may impact the Company. In addition, the Board Audit Committee Charter includes review information concerning environmental, legal, regulatory and other matters that may represent material financial exposure and/or material risk and appropriate management thereof. The ESG Steering Committee also routinely engages with the Presidents/CEOs from each of our operating companies.StrategyDisclose the actual and potential impacts of climate-related risks and opportunities on theorganizations businesses, strategy, and financial planning, including: a) Describe the climate related risks and opportunities the organization has identified over the short, medium and long term; b) Describe the impact of climate-related risks and opportunities on the organizations businesses, strategy and financial planning; and c) Describe the resilience of the organizations strategy, taking into consideration different climate-related scenarios, including a 2C or lower scenario.CDP Climate Change Questionnaire 2021 References: C2.1a, C2.3, C2.3a, C2.4, C2.4a, C3.2, C3.2a, C3.2b, C3.3, and C3.4Post maintains a TCFD-aligned global risk and opportunity assessment process that evaluates the relevancy of acute physical, chronic physical and transition and market risks and opportunities for our direct operations and supply chain. Our process for evaluating and monitoring climate-related risks and opportunities considers the following time horizons: short-term (0-2 years); medium-term (2-5 years); and long-term (5-10 years).For our baseline global assessment, we considered four distinct scenarios based upon a combination of physical and transition risks and the dynamics of average global warming degrees as described on page 28 of our 2022 ESG Report.The four scenarios are based upon a combination of physical and transition risks and the dynamics of average global warming degrees. If global temperatures go above 2C, the physical climate risks can be expected to be more frequent and intense. Conversely, if rapid decarbonization occurs through policies, regulations, innovation and consumer demand, then global temperatures will plateau or start to decrease, physical risks will lessen, and transition risks will become more dominant. It is also assumed that transition risks take a longer period forimplementation and impact, which results in scenarios that have medium- to long-term business implications.Additionally, it is expected scenario conditions will not be global and will vary by geography and time horizon (e.g., some geographies will accelerate decarbonization efforts faster than others). Posts approach is to evaluate the current and future relevance of these scenarios and monitoring changing conditions (e.g., a location moving from one scenario to a different one).Climate-related risks and opportunities are relevant to a consumer packaged goods companys entire value chain from raw material sourcing to the end of life or circularity for a given product. The impacts of physical and transition factors can influence our strategies, processes and decisions and can have both positive and potentially negative financial impacts. Our approach to climate adaptation and resiliency is based upon evaluating the following TCFD-defined opportunity categories as relevant to our company: Resource Efficiency: Pursuing more efficient raw material sourcing, production and transport. Energy Sourcing: Pursuing lower emission or renewable sources of energy. Products and Services: Responding to shifts in consumer preferences towards low carbon goods and services. Markets: Ability to access new and emerging markets due to more effective climate adaptation. Resilience: Pursuing enhanced business resiliency and ability to operate through various conditions and climate scenarios.From a climate risk perspective, over 75% of our production sites and approximately 90% of warehouse and distribution sites are exposed to a preferable scenario of low physical and low transition and market risks. Projecting into the future and the climate resiliency of our organization, it is possible that more of our production sites could be exposed to increased policy and market regulations and small number of sites could transition into a scenario of both higher physical and higher transition and market risks. Post Holdings is in the process of further evaluating our raw material sourcing from direct and indirect suppliers following a similar four-scenario method. Based upon our production sites being in Canada, the United States and the United Kingdom, we expected that the risk profile of our raw material sourcing will be like that of our production and warehouse portfolios.ManagementDisclose how the organization identifies, assesses, and manages climate-related risks, including: a) Describe the organizations processes for identifying and assessing climate-related risks; b) Describe the organizations processes for managing climate-related risks; and c) Describe how processes for identifying, assessing and managing climate-related risks are integrated into the organizations overall risk management.CDP Climate Change Questionnaire 2021 References: C2.1, C2.1a, C2.2, and C2.2aPosts process for evaluating acute physical, chronic physical, and transition risks and opportunities uses location specific inputs from widely recognized, publicly available data sources and risk categories including the following:Data Sources World Resources Institute (WRI) Aqueduct WWF Water Risk Filter Department of Homeland Security FEMA National Risk Index Alliance for Zero Extinction Conservation International Biodiversity Hotspot Key Biodiversity Area (KBA) Partnership Energy Information Administration (EIA) Energy & Climate Intelligence Unit (ECIU) Net Zero Scorecard United Nations Framework Convention onClimate Change (UNFCC) Nationally DeterminedContributions (NDC) Registry Location-specific contextual data from varioussources (e.g., energy mix, utility renewableenergy targets, net metering status and carbonpricing mechanisms)Risk Categories Extreme weather (avalanches/winter weather/cold waves, earthquakes, hail, hurricanes, icestorms, landslides, lightning, strong winds/tornadoes, tsunamis, volcanic activity andwildfires) Inland/riverine floods Water stress (availability and quality) Drought / Heat waves Coastal floods / Sea level rise Biodiversity and sensitive habitats Transition and marketThere are three main components to Posts strategy for managing climate-related risks and opportunities:1) Decarbonization: Post is committed to a 30% reduction in our GHG emissions within direct operations, Scope 1 and 2, by 2030. In fiscal year 2022, Post developed our Scope 3 GHG emissions baseline using the spend-based method. Post remains committed to reducing Scope 3 emissions and setting a goal but has delayed public announcement pending relevant climate-related regulations expected to be finalized in early 2023. In preparation for setting a goal, we utilized our baseline Scope 3 emissions profile to benchmark the GHG programs of our key suppliers and goal options. Our Weetabix business continues to explore Science Based Targets and will set new 2030 targets in 2023 with an ambition of operating as a net zero business by 2050.2) Climate Resiliency: The Post Risk Management function oversees a comprehensive program to evaluate and mitigate risks to our business, assets and people including consideration of climate-related risks and resiliency. The program includes periodic internal and external, by our commercial insurance partner, assessments risk exposure and preparedness. This insight is utilized to prioritize further evaluations, develop or enhance business continuity plans, and where necessary implement insurance mechanisms.3) Transparency: Post is committed to disclosing our plans and progress related to climate risks and opportunities, including participation in the annual CDP Climate questionnaire, an annual ESG Report, maintaining information on our website and this TCFD index.Metrics and TargetsDisclose the metrics and targets used to assess and manage relevant climate-related risks andopportunities, including: a) Disclose the metrics used by the organization to assess climate-related risks and opportunities in line with its strategy and risk management process; b) Disclose Scope 1, Scope 2 and, if appropriate, Scope 3 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and the related risks; and c) Describe the targets used by the organization to manage climate-related risks and opportunities and performance against targets.CDP Climate Change Questionnaire 2021 References: C4.1, C4.1a, C5 (all), C6.1, C6.3, C6.5, C7 (all), and C8 (all)Post has a culture of continuous improvement, which includes utilizing metrics and targets to evaluate and drive performance.

We are pursuing thisobjective in two ways: 1) standardization of practices andprocesses across the enterprise, with a focus in the pastyear on environmental accounting, internal ESG Guidelines,and supplier qualification, assurance and traceability; and2) collaborating with key functions.

One business may be focused on further enhancinganimal welfare practices, while another where that topic is notrelevant may be more focused on sustainable packaging. This isa strength of being a holding company, allowing our organizationto be more agile and responsive to the unique opportunitiesthat an ESG focus provides.

Sustainable PackagingOur focus is on supporting eachbusiness to advance sustainablepackaging, including activeparticipation in the SustainablePackaging Coalition, implementingHow2Recycle labels acrossproducts and outlining forward looking roadmaps.3. Responsible MarketingOur focus is on continuousenhancement of our processes toensure our products are responsiblymarketed.FOOD QUALITY AND SAFETYFood Safety Management SystemsWe verify the effective implementation of food safety managementsystems at our manufacturing and warehousing facilities throughthe use of internal and third-party audits. Third-party auditorsassess our company-owned and co-manufacturer facilities alikeagainst international standards such as SQF, BRC and FSSC22000,which have been approved by the Global Food Safety Initiative(GFSI). GFSI is a global organization for benchmarking andharmonizing of food safety auditing and certifications standards.For our supplier facilities, we implement risk-based qualitymanagement programs whereby external assessments areevaluated against the GFSI approved standards.We have processes in place to quickly identify and communicatefood safety risks and drive timely risk management, including,where necessary, recall measures. Our ingredients, packagingmaterials, finished products and critical controls are traced,enabling us to investigate and address any potential concerns inthe marketplace. Our internal food safety assurance systems areable to continuously monitor for errors during production. Thesesystems position Post to proactively withdraw affected products ina timely manner and in compliance with all applicable regulations.In fiscal year 2022, the Post businesses had one product recallrelated to mislabeling of a small quantity of product.Continuous ImprovementWe are committed to continuously improving our food safetymanagement systems. We define, track and report on metrics forsafety of products and robustness of our preventive controls. Weset targets and invest resources in our facilities to drive continuousimprovement in those metrics and our food safety managementsystems.

SPC membership also exposes us to new ideas,allows us to network with other leadership companies and offerspotential collaboration opportunities with SPC. Weetabix followsthe aims of WRAPs UK Plastics Pack and joined as a member inthe past year.Consumer EngagementWhile we are committed to continuously improving our packaging,it is important to ensure consumers have the necessaryinformation to do their part to optimize recycling. Post committedto implementing How2Recycle (H2R) labels across our portfolio ofbrands and products and in 2022 developed an internal guidelineto help accelerate efforts across all businesses. H2R is the nextgeneration recycling label that helps inform consumers how todispose of or recycle packaging accurately and where to go if theyneed to find information specific to their municipality.In the U.K., our Weetabix business ran a campaign withsustainability influencer Dougie Poynter to encourage our drinkslovers to recycle their bottles and will be rolling out consumercommunications across social media accounts to remind everyoneto do their part.How2Recycle Labeling System Im excited about wherewe are today, as well aswhere we are headed onour packaging sustainabilityjourney. Our core strategies,which encompass quality,supply assurance and totalcost are all aligned with oursustainability goals.Dave BrownSenior Vice President, Chief Procurement Officer,Post Holdings85%Our Post Consumer Brands business has defined H2Rlabels for 85% of branded products.Packaging InnovationDuring fiscal year 2022, our Post Consumer Brands businessannounced a new commitment to design for 100% recyclablecereal and product packaging across its product base by 2025.The business is currently at 90% recyclable packaging due toa focus for several years on reducing the amount of packagingnecessary for our products. For example, we reduced plasticfilm usage in cereal bags by more than one million pounds whilemaintaining overall durability and quality. The year before, thePost Consumer Brands team reduced paper packaging materialusage by about 930,000 pounds. The packaging research anddevelopment teams are working to identify solutions to furtherclose the gap.Low-impact packaging is one of four strategic pillars of ourWeetabix Change for Better sustainability strategy. The focusis on reducing the overall impact of our packaging, which meanstaking a holistic view of all packaging choices and ensuring thatthey reduce waste and reduce emissions.Weetabix achieved 100% recyclability for all packaging, believingthis is the best option for its food-grade packaging. This wasachieved by successful changes, such as: Shifting to 100% recyclable bottles and reducing plastic by 10%for the Weetabix On The Go drinks range. Introducing an innovative new wrap for Weetabix, which is 100%recyclable in curbside collections.Many packaging innovations we are pursuing also result in carbonreductions. For example, the above two achievements alsoreduced our carbon footprint, removing 9% from our drinks rangeand 20% from Weetabix packaging.Food preservation also must remain front of mind in all ourpackaging decisions as food waste is arguably a bigger threatto the environment than packaging waste, with a bigger carbonfootprint. While there are plastic-free options available, many ofthem dont keep our food fresh resulting in food waste and anincrease in carbon footprint compared to our existing packaging.Last year, Weetabix developed a model that predicts the effect ofdifferent materials on food waste, and it has been successful inhelping select materials to trial. We remain committed to doing allthe due diligence to find the best environmental solutions to keepthe impact of our packaging low. Were working all the timeto optimize the materials weuse in our packaging so thatwe achieve the best balance ofproduct protection and lowestimpact. This helps makeprogress on the sustainabilityfront, but it also ensuresour business operates asefficiently as we can.Mark TyrrellWeetabix Packaging Development ManagerRESPONSIBLE MARKETINGPost produces a wide portfolio of products that meet a varietyof consumer needs including value, taste, availability, nutritionand sustainability.

Inputs into our annualdiagnostic include: Previous Priorities External Trends Customer and Industry Benchmarking Standards and Industry Voices Investor Priorities and Rating ProfilesPrevious Prioritiestopics prioritized from ourbaseline ESG materialityassessment conducted in 2020and the nine topical focus areasfor 2021.External Trendsdefining societal and marketforces that must be consideredto be a future-looking andresilient company, such aslow carbon, circular, hypertransparent, food security,waste and accessibility andinclusiveness.Customer and IndustryBenchmarkingreviewing the ESG programsand priorities of our keycustomers and industry peers,as well as patterning ESGrelated surveys and inquiries.Standards and Industry Voicesconsidering leading ESGstandards such as theInternational SustainabilityStandards Board (ISSB),Sustainable AccountingStandards Board (SASB)Standards and the GlobalReporting Initiative (GRI) andleading voices such as theWorld Economic Forum (WEF).Investor Priorities and RatingProfilesevaluating the key elementsand themes from investorengagements and third-partyrating frameworks, suchas CDP, ISS, MSCI,Sustainalytics and Refinitiv.ESG Program PillarCurrent ESG Program Focus AreasSourcing Responsibility  Supplier ESG Practices  Commodity Traceability  Animal WelfareOperational Responsibility  EHS&S Data and KPIs  Energy and Climate  Environmental StewardshipProduct Responsibility  Food Quality and Safety  Sustainable Packaging  Responsible MarketingSocial Responsibility  Diversity, Equity and Inclusion  Empowering People  Community EngagementPILLAR NO. 1 Sourcing ResponsibilityOUR AMBITIONPost is committed to sourcing all direct and indirect ingredients,materials and services in a socially, ethically, environmentally andeconomically responsible manner. We aspire to have full traceability ofour sourcing supply chain, proactively monitor and manage ESG-relatedrisks and opportunities and consistently meet or exceed sourcing related expectations from relevant stakeholders.Business RelevanceOur businesses rely on steady supplies of ingredients andpackaging materials to be used in products, which arepurchased directly from approximately 2,300 domestic andinternational supplier facilities.Given our companys operational footprint, approximately 90% ofsupplier facilities providing ingredients and packaging materialsare located domestically in North America or Europe. The primaryingredients used by our businesses include wheat, oats, rice, corn,other grain products, eggs, pork, pasta, potatoes, cheese, milk,butter, vegetable oils, dairy- and vegetable-based proteins, sugarand other sweeteners, fruit, nuts and water. Our Foodserviceand Refrigerated Retail businesses also use corn and soybeanmeal as the primary grains fed to layer hens. A portion of our eggneeds comes from company-owned layer hens, and the balance ispurchased under third-party contracts and in the spot market. Wealso own and operate two potato farms. Our primary packagingmaterials include folding cartons, corrugated boxes, flexibleand rigid plastic film, trays and containers, beverage packagingand plastic lined cartonboard. The majority of our distribution isthrough a network of third-party common carriers, plus aninternal fleet for certain refrigerated retail products.Management ApproachOur approach to delivering on sourcing responsibilities isled by our Chief Procurement Officer with functional leadersfor ingredient and commodity risk management, packaging,contract manufacturing, corporate purchasing and indirectprocurement.As a holding company, procurement was historically managedby our individual businesses but has been centralized in recentyears, providing a comprehensive perspective on our supply chainand competitive advantages. Our procurement team collaborateswith other relevant functions, such as compliance and ethics andESG, to define supplier requirements and monitor conformanceusing analytical tools and direct engagement (e.g., surveys,audits and meetings). Each of our businesses is also supportedto identify sourcing options and ensure that products meetapplicable standards, certifications and customer requirements,where applicable, for example, non-GMO, organic, gluten-freeand/or cage-free. Post considers the members of our supplychain important business partners, and we expect our suppliersto share our high standard of business ethics and act in a socially,environmentally and economically responsible manner. To ensuresuppliers follow our standards, we engage them through anenterprise-wide Supplier Qualification and Assurance Program.2023 ESG Focus Areas1.

The team accomplished this by decreasing the thicknessof the bags in most Post and Malt-O-Meal cereal products, whilestill maintaining their overall durability and quality. Plastic isnt theonly packaging material were working to reduce our usage of.Last year, we reduced paper packaging material usage by about930,000 pounds.Early in 2022, the team shifted their focus to recyclability, and PostConsumer Brands committed to designing for 100% recyclablecereal and product packaging by 2025. Currently, about 90% ofthe packaging materials, by weight, that Post Consumer Brandsuses in manufacturing plants are made from recycled content orrenewable resources and can be recycled by consumers.CHEP Pallet ProgramWe are proud to work with CHEP, a trusted partner and global leader in sustainably movinggoods. CHEP has a share and reuse pallet program that helps bring several efficiencies andenvironmental benefits to our sites in comparison with one-way, single-use solutions.

This waste material is high in protein andother key nutrients and should be beneficially reusedand not become food waste. The proposed initiativewould repurpose the hard-cooked egg waste into aningredient in pet food. This project has the potentialto divert approximately 2,500 tons of waste from thelandfill each year, as well as achieve significant costsavings for the business.BIODIVERSITYPost believes in the need to operate in harmony with nature andecosystems.

Post committedto implementing How2Recycle (H2R) labels across our portfolio ofbrands and products and in 2022 developed an internal guidelineto help accelerate efforts across all businesses. H2R is the nextgeneration recycling label that helps inform consumers how todispose of or recycle packaging accurately and where to go if theyneed to find information specific to their municipality.In the U.K., our Weetabix business ran a campaign withsustainability influencer Dougie Poynter to encourage our drinkslovers to recycle their bottles and will be rolling out consumercommunications across social media accounts to remind everyoneto do their part.How2Recycle Labeling System Im excited about wherewe are today, as well aswhere we are headed onour packaging sustainabilityjourney. Our core strategies,which encompass quality,supply assurance and totalcost are all aligned with oursustainability goals.Dave BrownSenior Vice President, Chief Procurement Officer,Post Holdings85%Our Post Consumer Brands business has defined H2Rlabels for 85% of branded products.Packaging InnovationDuring fiscal year 2022, our Post Consumer Brands businessannounced a new commitment to design for 100% recyclablecereal and product packaging across its product base by 2025.The business is currently at 90% recyclable packaging due toa focus for several years on reducing the amount of packagingnecessary for our products. For example, we reduced plasticfilm usage in cereal bags by more than one million pounds whilemaintaining overall durability and quality. The year before, thePost Consumer Brands team reduced paper packaging materialusage by about 930,000 pounds. The packaging research anddevelopment teams are working to identify solutions to furtherclose the gap.Low-impact packaging is one of four strategic pillars of ourWeetabix Change for Better sustainability strategy. The focusis on reducing the overall impact of our packaging, which meanstaking a holistic view of all packaging choices and ensuring thatthey reduce waste and reduce emissions.Weetabix achieved 100% recyclability for all packaging, believingthis is the best option for its food-grade packaging. This wasachieved by successful changes, such as: Shifting to 100% recyclable bottles and reducing plastic by 10%for the Weetabix On The Go drinks range. Introducing an innovative new wrap for Weetabix, which is 100%recyclable in curbside collections.Many packaging innovations we are pursuing also result in carbonreductions. For example, the above two achievements alsoreduced our carbon footprint, removing 9% from our drinks rangeand 20% from Weetabix packaging.Food preservation also must remain front of mind in all ourpackaging decisions as food waste is arguably a bigger threatto the environment than packaging waste, with a bigger carbonfootprint. While there are plastic-free options available, many ofthem dont keep our food fresh resulting in food waste and anincrease in carbon footprint compared to our existing packaging.Last year, Weetabix developed a model that predicts the effect ofdifferent materials on food waste, and it has been successful inhelping select materials to trial. We remain committed to doing allthe due diligence to find the best environmental solutions to keepthe impact of our packaging low. Were working all the timeto optimize the materials weuse in our packaging so thatwe achieve the best balance ofproduct protection and lowestimpact.

Post committedto implementing How2Recycle (H2R) labels across our portfolio ofbrands and products and in 2022 developed an internal guidelineto help accelerate efforts across all businesses. H2R is the nextgeneration recycling label that helps inform consumers how todispose of or recycle packaging accurately and where to go if theyneed to find information specific to their municipality.In the U.K., our Weetabix business ran a campaign withsustainability influencer Dougie Poynter to encourage our drinkslovers to recycle their bottles and will be rolling out consumercommunications across social media accounts to remind everyoneto do their part.How2Recycle Labeling System Im excited about wherewe are today, as well aswhere we are headed onour packaging sustainabilityjourney. Our core strategies,which encompass quality,supply assurance and totalcost are all aligned with oursustainability goals.Dave BrownSenior Vice President, Chief Procurement Officer,Post Holdings85%Our Post Consumer Brands business has defined H2Rlabels for 85% of branded products.Packaging InnovationDuring fiscal year 2022, our Post Consumer Brands businessannounced a new commitment to design for 100% recyclablecereal and product packaging across its product base by 2025.The business is currently at 90% recyclable packaging due toa focus for several years on reducing the amount of packagingnecessary for our products. For example, we reduced plasticfilm usage in cereal bags by more than one million pounds whilemaintaining overall durability and quality. The year before, thePost Consumer Brands team reduced paper packaging materialusage by about 930,000 pounds. The packaging research anddevelopment teams are working to identify solutions to furtherclose the gap.Low-impact packaging is one of four strategic pillars of ourWeetabix Change for Better sustainability strategy. The focusis on reducing the overall impact of our packaging, which meanstaking a holistic view of all packaging choices and ensuring thatthey reduce waste and reduce emissions.Weetabix achieved 100% recyclability for all packaging, believingthis is the best option for its food-grade packaging. This wasachieved by successful changes, such as: Shifting to 100% recyclable bottles and reducing plastic by 10%for the Weetabix On The Go drinks range. Introducing an innovative new wrap for Weetabix, which is 100%recyclable in curbside collections.Many packaging innovations we are pursuing also result in carbonreductions. For example, the above two achievements alsoreduced our carbon footprint, removing 9% from our drinks rangeand 20% from Weetabix packaging.Food preservation also must remain front of mind in all ourpackaging decisions as food waste is arguably a bigger threatto the environment than packaging waste, with a bigger carbonfootprint. While there are plastic-free options available, many ofthem dont keep our food fresh resulting in food waste and anincrease in carbon footprint compared to our existing packaging.Last year, Weetabix developed a model that predicts the effect ofdifferent materials on food waste, and it has been successful inhelping select materials to trial. We remain committed to doing allthe due diligence to find the best environmental solutions to keepthe impact of our packaging low. Were working all the timeto optimize the materials weuse in our packaging so thatwe achieve the best balance ofproduct protection and lowestimpact.

For additionaldetails, please reference responses in ourCDP 2022 Climate Change Questionnaireavailable at www.cdp.net.GovernanceDisclose the organizations governance around climate-related risks and opportunities, including: a) Describe the boards oversight of climate-related risks and opportunities; and b) Describe managements role in assessing and managing climate-related risks and opportunities.CDP Climate Change Questionnaire 2021 References: C1.1a, C1.1b, C1.2, and C1.2aPost Holdings, Inc. President and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) serves on the Board of Directors and is frequently and directly engaged with our Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) Steering Committee, which oversees climate-related issues. Our President and CEO is regularly briefed on ESG and sustainability topics and progress by our ESG Senior Director and our ESG Steering Committee. Given carbon and climate change are an important topic for our key customers and investors, this topic is consistently included in briefings. TheThe ESG Steering Committee, which is led by our ESG Senior Director, includes leaders from global procurement, communications, legal, investor relations, and operations and reports directly to our Executive Vice President, General Counsel and Chief Administrative Officer.The ESG Steering Committee provides information and recommendations to the full Board of Directors, including climate-related risks and opportunities, at scheduled meetings and as important issues arise. As stated in our Corporate Governance Guidelines, The Board shall oversee matters relating to the Companys environmental, social and governance (ESG) practices and initiatives, as well as other social issues important to the Companysconstituents. The Board shall review the Companys annual or periodic ESG reports and consider significant ESG trends that may impact the Company. In addition, the Board Audit Committee Charter includes review information concerning environmental, legal, regulatory and other matters that may represent material financial exposure and/or material risk and appropriate management thereof. The ESG Steering Committee also routinely engages with the Presidents/CEOs from each of our operating companies.StrategyDisclose the actual and potential impacts of climate-related risks and opportunities on theorganizations businesses, strategy, and financial planning, including: a) Describe the climate related risks and opportunities the organization has identified over the short, medium and long term; b) Describe the impact of climate-related risks and opportunities on the organizations businesses, strategy and financial planning; and c) Describe the resilience of the organizations strategy, taking into consideration different climate-related scenarios, including a 2C or lower scenario.CDP Climate Change Questionnaire 2021 References: C2.1a, C2.3, C2.3a, C2.4, C2.4a, C3.2, C3.2a, C3.2b, C3.3, and C3.4Post maintains a TCFD-aligned global risk and opportunity assessment process that evaluates the relevancy of acute physical, chronic physical and transition and market risks and opportunities for our direct operations and supply chain. Our process for evaluating and monitoring climate-related risks and opportunities considers the following time horizons: short-term (0-2 years); medium-term (2-5 years); and long-term (5-10 years).For our baseline global assessment, we considered four distinct scenarios based upon a combination of physical and transition risks and the dynamics of average global warming degrees as described on page 28 of our 2022 ESG Report.The four scenarios are based upon a combination of physical and transition risks and the dynamics of average global warming degrees. If global temperatures go above 2C, the physical climate risks can be expected to be more frequent and intense. Conversely, if rapid decarbonization occurs through policies, regulations, innovation and consumer demand, then global temperatures will plateau or start to decrease, physical risks will lessen, and transition risks will become more dominant. It is also assumed that transition risks take a longer period forimplementation and impact, which results in scenarios that have medium- to long-term business implications.Additionally, it is expected scenario conditions will not be global and will vary by geography and time horizon (e.g., some geographies will accelerate decarbonization efforts faster than others). Posts approach is to evaluate the current and future relevance of these scenarios and monitoring changing conditions (e.g., a location moving from one scenario to a different one).Climate-related risks and opportunities are relevant to a consumer packaged goods companys entire value chain from raw material sourcing to the end of life or circularity for a given product. The impacts of physical and transition factors can influence our strategies, processes and decisions and can have both positive and potentially negative financial impacts. Our approach to climate adaptation and resiliency is based upon evaluating the following TCFD-defined opportunity categories as relevant to our company: Resource Efficiency: Pursuing more efficient raw material sourcing, production and transport. Energy Sourcing: Pursuing lower emission or renewable sources of energy. Products and Services: Responding to shifts in consumer preferences towards low carbon goods and services. Markets: Ability to access new and emerging markets due to more effective climate adaptation. Resilience: Pursuing enhanced business resiliency and ability to operate through various conditions and climate scenarios.From a climate risk perspective, over 75% of our production sites and approximately 90% of warehouse and distribution sites are exposed to a preferable scenario of low physical and low transition and market risks. Projecting into the future and the climate resiliency of our organization, it is possible that more of our production sites could be exposed to increased policy and market regulations and small number of sites could transition into a scenario of both higher physical and higher transition and market risks. Post Holdings is in the process of further evaluating our raw material sourcing from direct and indirect suppliers following a similar four-scenario method. Based upon our production sites being in Canada, the United States and the United Kingdom, we expected that the risk profile of our raw material sourcing will be like that of our production and warehouse portfolios.ManagementDisclose how the organization identifies, assesses, and manages climate-related risks, including: a) Describe the organizations processes for identifying and assessing climate-related risks; b) Describe the organizations processes for managing climate-related risks; and c) Describe how processes for identifying, assessing and managing climate-related risks are integrated into the organizations overall risk management.CDP Climate Change Questionnaire 2021 References: C2.1, C2.1a, C2.2, and C2.2aPosts process for evaluating acute physical, chronic physical, and transition risks and opportunities uses location specific inputs from widely recognized, publicly available data sources and risk categories including the following:Data Sources World Resources Institute (WRI) Aqueduct WWF Water Risk Filter Department of Homeland Security FEMA National Risk Index Alliance for Zero Extinction Conservation International Biodiversity Hotspot Key Biodiversity Area (KBA) Partnership Energy Information Administration (EIA) Energy & Climate Intelligence Unit (ECIU) Net Zero Scorecard United Nations Framework Convention onClimate Change (UNFCC) Nationally DeterminedContributions (NDC) Registry Location-specific contextual data from varioussources (e.g., energy mix, utility renewableenergy targets, net metering status and carbonpricing mechanisms)Risk Categories Extreme weather (avalanches/winter weather/cold waves, earthquakes, hail, hurricanes, icestorms, landslides, lightning, strong winds/tornadoes, tsunamis, volcanic activity andwildfires) Inland/riverine floods Water stress (availability and quality) Drought / Heat waves Coastal floods / Sea level rise Biodiversity and sensitive habitats Transition and marketThere are three main components to Posts strategy for managing climate-related risks and opportunities:1) Decarbonization: Post is committed to a 30% reduction in our GHG emissions within direct operations, Scope 1 and 2, by 2030. In fiscal year 2022, Post developed our Scope 3 GHG emissions baseline using the spend-based method. Post remains committed to reducing Scope 3 emissions and setting a goal but has delayed public announcement pending relevant climate-related regulations expected to be finalized in early 2023. In preparation for setting a goal, we utilized our baseline Scope 3 emissions profile to benchmark the GHG programs of our key suppliers and goal options. Our Weetabix business continues to explore Science Based Targets and will set new 2030 targets in 2023 with an ambition of operating as a net zero business by 2050.2) Climate Resiliency: The Post Risk Management function oversees a comprehensive program to evaluate and mitigate risks to our business, assets and people including consideration of climate-related risks and resiliency. The program includes periodic internal and external, by our commercial insurance partner, assessments risk exposure and preparedness. This insight is utilized to prioritize further evaluations, develop or enhance business continuity plans, and where necessary implement insurance mechanisms.3) Transparency: Post is committed to disclosing our plans and progress related to climate risks and opportunities, including participation in the annual CDP Climate questionnaire, an annual ESG Report, maintaining information on our website and this TCFD index.Metrics and TargetsDisclose the metrics and targets used to assess and manage relevant climate-related risks andopportunities, including: a) Disclose the metrics used by the organization to assess climate-related risks and opportunities in line with its strategy and risk management process; b) Disclose Scope 1, Scope 2 and, if appropriate, Scope 3 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and the related risks; and c) Describe the targets used by the organization to manage climate-related risks and opportunities and performance against targets.CDP Climate Change Questionnaire 2021 References: C4.1, C4.1a, C5 (all), C6.1, C6.3, C6.5, C7 (all), and C8 (all)Post has a culture of continuous improvement, which includes utilizing metrics and targets to evaluate and drive performance.

President and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) serves on the Board of Directors and is frequently and directly engaged with our Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) Steering Committee, which oversees climate-related issues. Our President and CEO is regularly briefed on ESG and sustainability topics and progress by our ESG Senior Director and our ESG Steering Committee. Given carbon and climate change are an important topic for our key customers and investors, this topic is consistently included in briefings. TheThe ESG Steering Committee, which is led by our ESG Senior Director, includes leaders from global procurement, communications, legal, investor relations, and operations and reports directly to our Executive Vice President, General Counsel and Chief Administrative Officer.The ESG Steering Committee provides information and recommendations to the full Board of Directors, including climate-related risks and opportunities, at scheduled meetings and as important issues arise. As stated in our Corporate Governance Guidelines, The Board shall oversee matters relating to the Companys environmental, social and governance (ESG) practices and initiatives, as well as other social issues important to the Companysconstituents. The Board shall review the Companys annual or periodic ESG reports and consider significant ESG trends that may impact the Company. In addition, the Board Audit Committee Charter includes review information concerning environmental, legal, regulatory and other matters that may represent material financial exposure and/or material risk and appropriate management thereof. The ESG Steering Committee also routinely engages with the Presidents/CEOs from each of our operating companies.StrategyDisclose the actual and potential impacts of climate-related risks and opportunities on theorganizations businesses, strategy, and financial planning, including: a) Describe the climate related risks and opportunities the organization has identified over the short, medium and long term; b) Describe the impact of climate-related risks and opportunities on the organizations businesses, strategy and financial planning; and c) Describe the resilience of the organizations strategy, taking into consideration different climate-related scenarios, including a 2C or lower scenario.CDP Climate Change Questionnaire 2021 References: C2.1a, C2.3, C2.3a, C2.4, C2.4a, C3.2, C3.2a, C3.2b, C3.3, and C3.4Post maintains a TCFD-aligned global risk and opportunity assessment process that evaluates the relevancy of acute physical, chronic physical and transition and market risks and opportunities for our direct operations and supply chain. Our process for evaluating and monitoring climate-related risks and opportunities considers the following time horizons: short-term (0-2 years); medium-term (2-5 years); and long-term (5-10 years).For our baseline global assessment, we considered four distinct scenarios based upon a combination of physical and transition risks and the dynamics of average global warming degrees as described on page 28 of our 2022 ESG Report.The four scenarios are based upon a combination of physical and transition risks and the dynamics of average global warming degrees. If global temperatures go above 2C, the physical climate risks can be expected to be more frequent and intense. Conversely, if rapid decarbonization occurs through policies, regulations, innovation and consumer demand, then global temperatures will plateau or start to decrease, physical risks will lessen, and transition risks will become more dominant. It is also assumed that transition risks take a longer period forimplementation and impact, which results in scenarios that have medium- to long-term business implications.Additionally, it is expected scenario conditions will not be global and will vary by geography and time horizon (e.g., some geographies will accelerate decarbonization efforts faster than others). Posts approach is to evaluate the current and future relevance of these scenarios and monitoring changing conditions (e.g., a location moving from one scenario to a different one).Climate-related risks and opportunities are relevant to a consumer packaged goods companys entire value chain from raw material sourcing to the end of life or circularity for a given product. The impacts of physical and transition factors can influence our strategies, processes and decisions and can have both positive and potentially negative financial impacts. Our approach to climate adaptation and resiliency is based upon evaluating the following TCFD-defined opportunity categories as relevant to our company: Resource Efficiency: Pursuing more efficient raw material sourcing, production and transport. Energy Sourcing: Pursuing lower emission or renewable sources of energy. Products and Services: Responding to shifts in consumer preferences towards low carbon goods and services. Markets: Ability to access new and emerging markets due to more effective climate adaptation. Resilience: Pursuing enhanced business resiliency and ability to operate through various conditions and climate scenarios.From a climate risk perspective, over 75% of our production sites and approximately 90% of warehouse and distribution sites are exposed to a preferable scenario of low physical and low transition and market risks. Projecting into the future and the climate resiliency of our organization, it is possible that more of our production sites could be exposed to increased policy and market regulations and small number of sites could transition into a scenario of both higher physical and higher transition and market risks. Post Holdings is in the process of further evaluating our raw material sourcing from direct and indirect suppliers following a similar four-scenario method. Based upon our production sites being in Canada, the United States and the United Kingdom, we expected that the risk profile of our raw material sourcing will be like that of our production and warehouse portfolios.ManagementDisclose how the organization identifies, assesses, and manages climate-related risks, including: a) Describe the organizations processes for identifying and assessing climate-related risks; b) Describe the organizations processes for managing climate-related risks; and c) Describe how processes for identifying, assessing and managing climate-related risks are integrated into the organizations overall risk management.CDP Climate Change Questionnaire 2021 References: C2.1, C2.1a, C2.2, and C2.2aPosts process for evaluating acute physical, chronic physical, and transition risks and opportunities uses location specific inputs from widely recognized, publicly available data sources and risk categories including the following:Data Sources World Resources Institute (WRI) Aqueduct WWF Water Risk Filter Department of Homeland Security FEMA National Risk Index Alliance for Zero Extinction Conservation International Biodiversity Hotspot Key Biodiversity Area (KBA) Partnership Energy Information Administration (EIA) Energy & Climate Intelligence Unit (ECIU) Net Zero Scorecard United Nations Framework Convention onClimate Change (UNFCC) Nationally DeterminedContributions (NDC) Registry Location-specific contextual data from varioussources (e.g., energy mix, utility renewableenergy targets, net metering status and carbonpricing mechanisms)Risk Categories Extreme weather (avalanches/winter weather/cold waves, earthquakes, hail, hurricanes, icestorms, landslides, lightning, strong winds/tornadoes, tsunamis, volcanic activity andwildfires) Inland/riverine floods Water stress (availability and quality) Drought / Heat waves Coastal floods / Sea level rise Biodiversity and sensitive habitats Transition and marketThere are three main components to Posts strategy for managing climate-related risks and opportunities:1) Decarbonization: Post is committed to a 30% reduction in our GHG emissions within direct operations, Scope 1 and 2, by 2030. In fiscal year 2022, Post developed our Scope 3 GHG emissions baseline using the spend-based method. Post remains committed to reducing Scope 3 emissions and setting a goal but has delayed public announcement pending relevant climate-related regulations expected to be finalized in early 2023. In preparation for setting a goal, we utilized our baseline Scope 3 emissions profile to benchmark the GHG programs of our key suppliers and goal options. Our Weetabix business continues to explore Science Based Targets and will set new 2030 targets in 2023 with an ambition of operating as a net zero business by 2050.2) Climate Resiliency: The Post Risk Management function oversees a comprehensive program to evaluate and mitigate risks to our business, assets and people including consideration of climate-related risks and resiliency. The program includes periodic internal and external, by our commercial insurance partner, assessments risk exposure and preparedness. This insight is utilized to prioritize further evaluations, develop or enhance business continuity plans, and where necessary implement insurance mechanisms.3) Transparency: Post is committed to disclosing our plans and progress related to climate risks and opportunities, including participation in the annual CDP Climate questionnaire, an annual ESG Report, maintaining information on our website and this TCFD index.Metrics and TargetsDisclose the metrics and targets used to assess and manage relevant climate-related risks andopportunities, including: a) Disclose the metrics used by the organization to assess climate-related risks and opportunities in line with its strategy and risk management process; b) Disclose Scope 1, Scope 2 and, if appropriate, Scope 3 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and the related risks; and c) Describe the targets used by the organization to manage climate-related risks and opportunities and performance against targets.CDP Climate Change Questionnaire 2021 References: C4.1, C4.1a, C5 (all), C6.1, C6.3, C6.5, C7 (all), and C8 (all)Post has a culture of continuous improvement, which includes utilizing metrics and targets to evaluate and drive performance.

To be a responsiblecompany, our efforts related to water stewardship must be alignedwith providing high-quality and safe products to our consumers.We also realize that not all water is equal, so we are committedto assessing our water impact, particularly in high water stressenvironments. We all play a role, across the world, to worktogether in addressing shared water challenges including waterquantity, water quality, water governance, important water-relatedecosystems, water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) and resiliencyto extreme weather events.Our Commitment: Assess our water impact, particularly in high-stress environments.Our Progress in Fiscal Year 2022: In the past year, Post focusedon conducting a global water risk assessment of our operationalsites and enhancing our data collection capabilities to understandwater sourcing, use and discharge. Post currently has owned andoperated production sites and warehouses and distribution centersin North America and the United Kingdom. To assess sites locatedin regions of potentially high water stress, we used the followingdata sources:World Resources Institute (WRI) Aqueduct Water Risk AtlasWWF Water Risk FilterFEMA National Risk IndexBased upon our assessment, Post has identified the followingbreakdown of sites by water stress level projected to 2030:Water Stress LevelProduction SitesWarehouse and Distribution SitesHigh3%3%Medium20%6%Low77%91%Water Use and Intensity (million gallons and production volume intensity)YearWater UserWater Use IntensityFY20201,0930.288FY20211,3360.327FY20221,2410.288Incoming Water SourcesThird-Party Provider54%Groundwater46 %Compared to our fiscal year 2020 baseline, Post has had a 13.5% increasein total water use but a 1.5% decrease in water use intensity. Approximately5.5% of water use is in regions of high water stress. Our wastewater dischargevolume for fiscal year 2022 was 1,769 million gallons.Our Next Steps: Post will use the results of our global water riskassessment, combined with our water and wastewater data, toinform decisions on further assessment, actions and investments.A priority focus will be placed on sites located in high water stressgeographies to confirm sound water stewardship practices andconsider watershed engagement opportunities.WASTE MINIMIZATIONWaste minimization, recycling and reuse is of the utmostimportance to our business, the environment and society. Toreduce waste to landfill, we continuously work to identify andimplement best practices throughout our enterprise to eliminatewaste and optimize material recycling and reuse.Our Commitment: Assess our waste to landfill across theenterprise.Our Progress in Fiscal Year 2022: In the past year, Post wasfocused on understanding and validating our baseline wastegeneration, streams and diversion from landfill. Post has achievedan overall diversion from landfill rate of 90% for all non-hazardouswaste generated that was recycled or reused. This has beenachieved due to our Weetabix business maintaining zero wasteto landfill since 2016, our Michael Foods business diverting over93% of waste materials from landfills due to recycle, reuseand repurpose efforts and our Post Consumer Brands businessachieving a 96% landfill diversion rate.In fiscal year 2022, Post generated 866.7 million pounds ofnon-hazardous waste with 90% of this waste able to be divertedfrom landfills through recycling or reuse. Compared to our fiscalyear 2020 baseline, Post has reduced total non-hazardous wastegeneration by 12.5%.Our Next Steps: As waste service contracts are renewed atsites, we are working to eliminate wastes and optimize reuse andrecycling. We will also continue to drive best practice sharingacross our enterprise to further pursue our commitment toreducing waste to landfill.Non-Hazardous Waste and Landfill Diversion (million pounds and percent diversion from landfill)YearWaste DisposedWaste RecycledLandfill DiversionFY202087.8902.384%FY202177.4911.292%FY202287.5779.290%Waste RecycledLandfill Diversion (%)Post Consumer Brands Commits to Designing for 100%Recyclable Cereal Packaging by 2025Post Consumer Brands believes that one way to make the world abetter place is by continuously improving packaging so it uses fewermaterials and is easier for consumers to recycle. Over the past fewyears, the research and development team focused on reducing theamount of packaging needed for our products, including reducingplastic film usage in our cereal bags by more than one millionpounds. The team accomplished this by decreasing the thicknessof the bags in most Post and Malt-O-Meal cereal products, whilestill maintaining their overall durability and quality. Plastic isnt theonly packaging material were working to reduce our usage of.Last year, we reduced paper packaging material usage by about930,000 pounds.Early in 2022, the team shifted their focus to recyclability, and PostConsumer Brands committed to designing for 100% recyclablecereal and product packaging by 2025. Currently, about 90% ofthe packaging materials, by weight, that Post Consumer Brandsuses in manufacturing plants are made from recycled content orrenewable resources and can be recycled by consumers.CHEP Pallet ProgramWe are proud to work with CHEP, a trusted partner and global leader in sustainably movinggoods. CHEP has a share and reuse pallet program that helps bring several efficiencies andenvironmental benefits to our sites in comparison with one-way, single-use solutions. In 2022, our manufacturing operations using CHEP pallets avoided the following environmental impacts:pounds of CO2 equivalents (or 18,790 acres of U.S. forests)34Mboard-feet of lumber (or 1,341 mature trees)589Kpounds of waste generated (or waste generated by1,873 average U.S. citizens)3.4MNiagara Zero Waste FacilityThe Post Consumer Brands Niagara Falls plant has been a zerowaste-to-landfill site for seven years, after successful effortsto eliminate manufacturing and food waste from ending up in alandfill, by either recycling or reusing it.Meet the dedicated team who ensures that waste is managedsafely and efficiently and in a sustainable way that benefits thecompany, the community and our natural resources.Hard-Cooked Egg WasteMichael Foods is negotiating a waste initiative at oneof its plants that specializes in hard-cooked eggs.During the production process, eggs that do notcomply with customer specifications are traditionallyremoved from the production line and sent to thelandfill. This waste material is high in protein andother key nutrients and should be beneficially reusedand not become food waste. The proposed initiativewould repurpose the hard-cooked egg waste into aningredient in pet food.

Sustainable PackagingOur focus is on supporting eachbusiness to advance sustainablepackaging, including activeparticipation in the SustainablePackaging Coalition, implementingHow2Recycle labels acrossproducts and outlining forward looking roadmaps.3. Responsible MarketingOur focus is on continuousenhancement of our processes toensure our products are responsiblymarketed.FOOD QUALITY AND SAFETYFood Safety Management SystemsWe verify the effective implementation of food safety managementsystems at our manufacturing and warehousing facilities throughthe use of internal and third-party audits. Third-party auditorsassess our company-owned and co-manufacturer facilities alikeagainst international standards such as SQF, BRC and FSSC22000,which have been approved by the Global Food Safety Initiative(GFSI). GFSI is a global organization for benchmarking andharmonizing of food safety auditing and certifications standards.For our supplier facilities, we implement risk-based qualitymanagement programs whereby external assessments areevaluated against the GFSI approved standards.We have processes in place to quickly identify and communicatefood safety risks and drive timely risk management, including,where necessary, recall measures. Our ingredients, packagingmaterials, finished products and critical controls are traced,enabling us to investigate and address any potential concerns inthe marketplace. Our internal food safety assurance systems areable to continuously monitor for errors during production. Thesesystems position Post to proactively withdraw affected products ina timely manner and in compliance with all applicable regulations.In fiscal year 2022, the Post businesses had one product recallrelated to mislabeling of a small quantity of product.Continuous ImprovementWe are committed to continuously improving our food safetymanagement systems. We define, track and report on metrics forsafety of products and robustness of our preventive controls. Weset targets and invest resources in our facilities to drive continuousimprovement in those metrics and our food safety managementsystems.

Weetabix followsthe aims of WRAPs UK Plastics Pack and joined as a member inthe past year.Consumer EngagementWhile we are committed to continuously improving our packaging,it is important to ensure consumers have the necessaryinformation to do their part to optimize recycling. Post committedto implementing How2Recycle (H2R) labels across our portfolio ofbrands and products and in 2022 developed an internal guidelineto help accelerate efforts across all businesses. H2R is the nextgeneration recycling label that helps inform consumers how todispose of or recycle packaging accurately and where to go if theyneed to find information specific to their municipality.In the U.K., our Weetabix business ran a campaign withsustainability influencer Dougie Poynter to encourage our drinkslovers to recycle their bottles and will be rolling out consumercommunications across social media accounts to remind everyoneto do their part.How2Recycle Labeling System Im excited about wherewe are today, as well aswhere we are headed onour packaging sustainabilityjourney. Our core strategies,which encompass quality,supply assurance and totalcost are all aligned with oursustainability goals.Dave BrownSenior Vice President, Chief Procurement Officer,Post Holdings85%Our Post Consumer Brands business has defined H2Rlabels for 85% of branded products.Packaging InnovationDuring fiscal year 2022, our Post Consumer Brands businessannounced a new commitment to design for 100% recyclablecereal and product packaging across its product base by 2025.The business is currently at 90% recyclable packaging due toa focus for several years on reducing the amount of packagingnecessary for our products. For example, we reduced plasticfilm usage in cereal bags by more than one million pounds whilemaintaining overall durability and quality. The year before, thePost Consumer Brands team reduced paper packaging materialusage by about 930,000 pounds. The packaging research anddevelopment teams are working to identify solutions to furtherclose the gap.Low-impact packaging is one of four strategic pillars of ourWeetabix Change for Better sustainability strategy. The focusis on reducing the overall impact of our packaging, which meanstaking a holistic view of all packaging choices and ensuring thatthey reduce waste and reduce emissions.Weetabix achieved 100% recyclability for all packaging, believingthis is the best option for its food-grade packaging. This wasachieved by successful changes, such as: Shifting to 100% recyclable bottles and reducing plastic by 10%for the Weetabix On The Go drinks range. Introducing an innovative new wrap for Weetabix, which is 100%recyclable in curbside collections.Many packaging innovations we are pursuing also result in carbonreductions. For example, the above two achievements alsoreduced our carbon footprint, removing 9% from our drinks rangeand 20% from Weetabix packaging.Food preservation also must remain front of mind in all ourpackaging decisions as food waste is arguably a bigger threatto the environment than packaging waste, with a bigger carbonfootprint. While there are plastic-free options available, many ofthem dont keep our food fresh resulting in food waste and anincrease in carbon footprint compared to our existing packaging.Last year, Weetabix developed a model that predicts the effect ofdifferent materials on food waste, and it has been successful inhelping select materials to trial. We remain committed to doing allthe due diligence to find the best environmental solutions to keepthe impact of our packaging low. Were working all the timeto optimize the materials weuse in our packaging so thatwe achieve the best balance ofproduct protection and lowestimpact. This helps makeprogress on the sustainabilityfront, but it also ensuresour business operates asefficiently as we can.Mark TyrrellWeetabix Packaging Development ManagerRESPONSIBLE MARKETINGPost produces a wide portfolio of products that meet a varietyof consumer needs including value, taste, availability, nutritionand sustainability.

Post committedto implementing How2Recycle (H2R) labels across our portfolio ofbrands and products and in 2022 developed an internal guidelineto help accelerate efforts across all businesses. H2R is the nextgeneration recycling label that helps inform consumers how todispose of or recycle packaging accurately and where to go if theyneed to find information specific to their municipality.In the U.K., our Weetabix business ran a campaign withsustainability influencer Dougie Poynter to encourage our drinkslovers to recycle their bottles and will be rolling out consumercommunications across social media accounts to remind everyoneto do their part.How2Recycle Labeling System Im excited about wherewe are today, as well aswhere we are headed onour packaging sustainabilityjourney. Our core strategies,which encompass quality,supply assurance and totalcost are all aligned with oursustainability goals.Dave BrownSenior Vice President, Chief Procurement Officer,Post Holdings85%Our Post Consumer Brands business has defined H2Rlabels for 85% of branded products.Packaging InnovationDuring fiscal year 2022, our Post Consumer Brands businessannounced a new commitment to design for 100% recyclablecereal and product packaging across its product base by 2025.The business is currently at 90% recyclable packaging due toa focus for several years on reducing the amount of packagingnecessary for our products. For example, we reduced plasticfilm usage in cereal bags by more than one million pounds whilemaintaining overall durability and quality. The year before, thePost Consumer Brands team reduced paper packaging materialusage by about 930,000 pounds. The packaging research anddevelopment teams are working to identify solutions to furtherclose the gap.Low-impact packaging is one of four strategic pillars of ourWeetabix Change for Better sustainability strategy. The focusis on reducing the overall impact of our packaging, which meanstaking a holistic view of all packaging choices and ensuring thatthey reduce waste and reduce emissions.Weetabix achieved 100% recyclability for all packaging, believingthis is the best option for its food-grade packaging. This wasachieved by successful changes, such as: Shifting to 100% recyclable bottles and reducing plastic by 10%for the Weetabix On The Go drinks range. Introducing an innovative new wrap for Weetabix, which is 100%recyclable in curbside collections.Many packaging innovations we are pursuing also result in carbonreductions. For example, the above two achievements alsoreduced our carbon footprint, removing 9% from our drinks rangeand 20% from Weetabix packaging.Food preservation also must remain front of mind in all ourpackaging decisions as food waste is arguably a bigger threatto the environment than packaging waste, with a bigger carbonfootprint. While there are plastic-free options available, many ofthem dont keep our food fresh resulting in food waste and anincrease in carbon footprint compared to our existing packaging.Last year, Weetabix developed a model that predicts the effect ofdifferent materials on food waste, and it has been successful inhelping select materials to trial. We remain committed to doing allthe due diligence to find the best environmental solutions to keepthe impact of our packaging low. Were working all the timeto optimize the materials weuse in our packaging so thatwe achieve the best balance ofproduct protection and lowestimpact. This helps makeprogress on the sustainabilityfront, but it also ensuresour business operates asefficiently as we can.Mark TyrrellWeetabix Packaging Development ManagerRESPONSIBLE MARKETINGPost produces a wide portfolio of products that meet a varietyof consumer needs including value, taste, availability, nutritionand sustainability.

Itis possible some sites couldtransition to Scenario #2 withincreased exposure to bothhigher physical and transitionrisks.Warehouse and Distribution SitesApproximately 90% of ourwarehouse and distributionsites are exposed toScenario #3 and theremainder distributedacross the other threescenarios.We project the exposure forthese non-production sites toremain steady with the potentialthat some sites may transitionfrom Scenario #3 to #1.Raw Material SourcingPost Holdings is in the process of further evaluating our rawmaterial sourcing from direct and indirect suppliers followinga similar four-scenario method to what was used for ourowned and operated sites. Based upon our production sitesbeing in Canada, the United States and the United Kingdom,we expect that the risk profile of our raw material sourcingwill be like that of our production and warehouse portfolios.For additional information on our TCFD alignment and climateresiliency progress, see Appendix: TCFD Disclosure and our CDPClimate Disclosure at www.cdp.net.WATER AND WASTEWATERPost is committed to taking action to reduce overall waterconsumption and effectively manage wastewater dischargeto protect the health of local watersheds in support of UNSustainable Development Goal (SDG) 6. To be a responsiblecompany, our efforts related to water stewardship must be alignedwith providing high-quality and safe products to our consumers.We also realize that not all water is equal, so we are committedto assessing our water impact, particularly in high water stressenvironments. We all play a role, across the world, to worktogether in addressing shared water challenges including waterquantity, water quality, water governance, important water-relatedecosystems, water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) and resiliencyto extreme weather events.Our Commitment: Assess our water impact, particularly in high-stress environments.Our Progress in Fiscal Year 2022: In the past year, Post focusedon conducting a global water risk assessment of our operationalsites and enhancing our data collection capabilities to understandwater sourcing, use and discharge. Post currently has owned andoperated production sites and warehouses and distribution centersin North America and the United Kingdom. To assess sites locatedin regions of potentially high water stress, we used the followingdata sources:World Resources Institute (WRI) Aqueduct Water Risk AtlasWWF Water Risk FilterFEMA National Risk IndexBased upon our assessment, Post has identified the followingbreakdown of sites by water stress level projected to 2030:Water Stress LevelProduction SitesWarehouse and Distribution SitesHigh3%3%Medium20%6%Low77%91%Water Use and Intensity (million gallons and production volume intensity)YearWater UserWater Use IntensityFY20201,0930.288FY20211,3360.327FY20221,2410.288Incoming Water SourcesThird-Party Provider54%Groundwater46 %Compared to our fiscal year 2020 baseline, Post has had a 13.5% increasein total water use but a 1.5% decrease in water use intensity. Approximately5.5% of water use is in regions of high water stress. Our wastewater dischargevolume for fiscal year 2022 was 1,769 million gallons.Our Next Steps: Post will use the results of our global water riskassessment, combined with our water and wastewater data, toinform decisions on further assessment, actions and investments.A priority focus will be placed on sites located in high water stressgeographies to confirm sound water stewardship practices andconsider watershed engagement opportunities.WASTE MINIMIZATIONWaste minimization, recycling and reuse is of the utmostimportance to our business, the environment and society. Toreduce waste to landfill, we continuously work to identify andimplement best practices throughout our enterprise to eliminatewaste and optimize material recycling and reuse.Our Commitment: Assess our waste to landfill across theenterprise.Our Progress in Fiscal Year 2022: In the past year, Post wasfocused on understanding and validating our baseline wastegeneration, streams and diversion from landfill. Post has achievedan overall diversion from landfill rate of 90% for all non-hazardouswaste generated that was recycled or reused. This has beenachieved due to our Weetabix business maintaining zero wasteto landfill since 2016, our Michael Foods business diverting over93% of waste materials from landfills due to recycle, reuseand repurpose efforts and our Post Consumer Brands businessachieving a 96% landfill diversion rate.In fiscal year 2022, Post generated 866.7 million pounds ofnon-hazardous waste with 90% of this waste able to be divertedfrom landfills through recycling or reuse. Compared to our fiscalyear 2020 baseline, Post has reduced total non-hazardous wastegeneration by 12.5%.Our Next Steps: As waste service contracts are renewed atsites, we are working to eliminate wastes and optimize reuse andrecycling. We will also continue to drive best practice sharingacross our enterprise to further pursue our commitment toreducing waste to landfill.Non-Hazardous Waste and Landfill Diversion (million pounds and percent diversion from landfill)YearWaste DisposedWaste RecycledLandfill DiversionFY202087.8902.384%FY202177.4911.292%FY202287.5779.290%Waste RecycledLandfill Diversion (%)Post Consumer Brands Commits to Designing for 100%Recyclable Cereal Packaging by 2025Post Consumer Brands believes that one way to make the world abetter place is by continuously improving packaging so it uses fewermaterials and is easier for consumers to recycle. Over the past fewyears, the research and development team focused on reducing theamount of packaging needed for our products, including reducingplastic film usage in our cereal bags by more than one millionpounds. The team accomplished this by decreasing the thicknessof the bags in most Post and Malt-O-Meal cereal products, whilestill maintaining their overall durability and quality. Plastic isnt theonly packaging material were working to reduce our usage of.Last year, we reduced paper packaging material usage by about930,000 pounds.Early in 2022, the team shifted their focus to recyclability, and PostConsumer Brands committed to designing for 100% recyclablecereal and product packaging by 2025. Currently, about 90% ofthe packaging materials, by weight, that Post Consumer Brandsuses in manufacturing plants are made from recycled content orrenewable resources and can be recycled by consumers.CHEP Pallet ProgramWe are proud to work with CHEP, a trusted partner and global leader in sustainably movinggoods. CHEP has a share and reuse pallet program that helps bring several efficiencies andenvironmental benefits to our sites in comparison with one-way, single-use solutions.

This waste material is high in protein andother key nutrients and should be beneficially reusedand not become food waste. The proposed initiativewould repurpose the hard-cooked egg waste into aningredient in pet food. This project has the potentialto divert approximately 2,500 tons of waste from thelandfill each year, as well as achieve significant costsavings for the business.BIODIVERSITYPost believes in the need to operate in harmony with nature andecosystems. Maintaining biodiversity, especially for sensitive orthreatened habitats, is fundamentally important to protecting floraand fauna, preserving local culture, combating climate change andsupporting a stable economy.Our Commitment: Assess our proximity to biodiversity sensitivehabitats.Our Progress in Fiscal Year 2022: In the past year, Post focusedon conducting a global biodiversity assessment, which evaluatedthe proximity of our owned and operated production sites andwarehouse and distribution centers to sensitive or threatenedhabitats and species. To assess site proximity, we used thefollowing recognized data sources:Alliance for Zero Extinction (AZE) Global AZE MapConservation International Biodiversity Hotspots and CriticalEcosystem Partnership Fund (CEPF)Key Biodiversity Areas (KBA) PartnershipBased upon our assessment, Post identified the followingbreakdown of sites by proximity to protected areas and areasof high biodiversity:ProximityProduction SitesWarehouse & Distribution SitesNot Near88%84%Within10 miles12%9% within large NorthAmerican Coastal Plainin southeast and easternU.S.; 3% near Great RiversConfluence or the NiagaraRiver Corridor16%10% within the large NorthAmerican Coastal Plain insoutheast and eastern U.S.;3% within the large CaliforniaFloristic Province; 3% locatednear the Boundary Bay Roberts Bank  Sturgeon Bank(Fraser River Estuary) or theMidewin National TallgrassPrairieOur Next Steps: The results of our assessment, combined withour environmental data, is used to inform decisions on furtherassessment to confirm no direct or indirect impacts, actionsto monitor and mitigate any future impacts, and investmentsincluding consideration for prioritizing local communityengagement initiatives.The Queens Green CanopyIn recognition of her lateMajestys Jubilee, Weetabixwanted to celebrate in a way thatbenefits its local surroundings.That is why we committed toplanting one tree for everyWeetabix employee, whichequals 1,000 trees, creating agreen space for years to comethat everyone can enjoy.Read MorePost Consumer Brands Natural Prairie and Pollinator PlantsThe grassy areas surrounding Post Consumer Brandsheadquarters building were planted with native Minnesota prairiegrasses.

Post committedto implementing How2Recycle (H2R) labels across our portfolio ofbrands and products and in 2022 developed an internal guidelineto help accelerate efforts across all businesses. H2R is the nextgeneration recycling label that helps inform consumers how todispose of or recycle packaging accurately and where to go if theyneed to find information specific to their municipality.In the U.K., our Weetabix business ran a campaign withsustainability influencer Dougie Poynter to encourage our drinkslovers to recycle their bottles and will be rolling out consumercommunications across social media accounts to remind everyoneto do their part.How2Recycle Labeling System Im excited about wherewe are today, as well aswhere we are headed onour packaging sustainabilityjourney. Our core strategies,which encompass quality,supply assurance and totalcost are all aligned with oursustainability goals.Dave BrownSenior Vice President, Chief Procurement Officer,Post Holdings85%Our Post Consumer Brands business has defined H2Rlabels for 85% of branded products.Packaging InnovationDuring fiscal year 2022, our Post Consumer Brands businessannounced a new commitment to design for 100% recyclablecereal and product packaging across its product base by 2025.The business is currently at 90% recyclable packaging due toa focus for several years on reducing the amount of packagingnecessary for our products. For example, we reduced plasticfilm usage in cereal bags by more than one million pounds whilemaintaining overall durability and quality. The year before, thePost Consumer Brands team reduced paper packaging materialusage by about 930,000 pounds. The packaging research anddevelopment teams are working to identify solutions to furtherclose the gap.Low-impact packaging is one of four strategic pillars of ourWeetabix Change for Better sustainability strategy. The focusis on reducing the overall impact of our packaging, which meanstaking a holistic view of all packaging choices and ensuring thatthey reduce waste and reduce emissions.Weetabix achieved 100% recyclability for all packaging, believingthis is the best option for its food-grade packaging. This wasachieved by successful changes, such as: Shifting to 100% recyclable bottles and reducing plastic by 10%for the Weetabix On The Go drinks range. Introducing an innovative new wrap for Weetabix, which is 100%recyclable in curbside collections.Many packaging innovations we are pursuing also result in carbonreductions. For example, the above two achievements alsoreduced our carbon footprint, removing 9% from our drinks rangeand 20% from Weetabix packaging.Food preservation also must remain front of mind in all ourpackaging decisions as food waste is arguably a bigger threatto the environment than packaging waste, with a bigger carbonfootprint. While there are plastic-free options available, many ofthem dont keep our food fresh resulting in food waste and anincrease in carbon footprint compared to our existing packaging.Last year, Weetabix developed a model that predicts the effect ofdifferent materials on food waste, and it has been successful inhelping select materials to trial. We remain committed to doing allthe due diligence to find the best environmental solutions to keepthe impact of our packaging low. Were working all the timeto optimize the materials weuse in our packaging so thatwe achieve the best balance ofproduct protection and lowestimpact.

GFSI is a global organization for benchmarking andharmonizing of food safety auditing and certifications standards.For our supplier facilities, we implement risk-based qualitymanagement programs whereby external assessments areevaluated against the GFSI approved standards.We have processes in place to quickly identify and communicatefood safety risks and drive timely risk management, including,where necessary, recall measures. Our ingredients, packagingmaterials, finished products and critical controls are traced,enabling us to investigate and address any potential concerns inthe marketplace. Our internal food safety assurance systems areable to continuously monitor for errors during production. Thesesystems position Post to proactively withdraw affected products ina timely manner and in compliance with all applicable regulations.In fiscal year 2022, the Post businesses had one product recallrelated to mislabeling of a small quantity of product.Continuous ImprovementWe are committed to continuously improving our food safetymanagement systems.

SPC membership also exposes us to new ideas,allows us to network with other leadership companies and offerspotential collaboration opportunities with SPC. Weetabix followsthe aims of WRAPs UK Plastics Pack and joined as a member inthe past year.Consumer EngagementWhile we are committed to continuously improving our packaging,it is important to ensure consumers have the necessaryinformation to do their part to optimize recycling. Post committedto implementing How2Recycle (H2R) labels across our portfolio ofbrands and products and in 2022 developed an internal guidelineto help accelerate efforts across all businesses. H2R is the nextgeneration recycling label that helps inform consumers how todispose of or recycle packaging accurately and where to go if theyneed to find information specific to their municipality.In the U.K., our Weetabix business ran a campaign withsustainability influencer Dougie Poynter to encourage our drinkslovers to recycle their bottles and will be rolling out consumercommunications across social media accounts to remind everyoneto do their part.How2Recycle Labeling System Im excited about wherewe are today, as well aswhere we are headed onour packaging sustainabilityjourney. Our core strategies,which encompass quality,supply assurance and totalcost are all aligned with oursustainability goals.Dave BrownSenior Vice President, Chief Procurement Officer,Post Holdings85%Our Post Consumer Brands business has defined H2Rlabels for 85% of branded products.Packaging InnovationDuring fiscal year 2022, our Post Consumer Brands businessannounced a new commitment to design for 100% recyclablecereal and product packaging across its product base by 2025.The business is currently at 90% recyclable packaging due toa focus for several years on reducing the amount of packagingnecessary for our products. For example, we reduced plasticfilm usage in cereal bags by more than one million pounds whilemaintaining overall durability and quality. The year before, thePost Consumer Brands team reduced paper packaging materialusage by about 930,000 pounds. The packaging research anddevelopment teams are working to identify solutions to furtherclose the gap.Low-impact packaging is one of four strategic pillars of ourWeetabix Change for Better sustainability strategy. The focusis on reducing the overall impact of our packaging, which meanstaking a holistic view of all packaging choices and ensuring thatthey reduce waste and reduce emissions.Weetabix achieved 100% recyclability for all packaging, believingthis is the best option for its food-grade packaging. This wasachieved by successful changes, such as: Shifting to 100% recyclable bottles and reducing plastic by 10%for the Weetabix On The Go drinks range. Introducing an innovative new wrap for Weetabix, which is 100%recyclable in curbside collections.Many packaging innovations we are pursuing also result in carbonreductions. For example, the above two achievements alsoreduced our carbon footprint, removing 9% from our drinks rangeand 20% from Weetabix packaging.Food preservation also must remain front of mind in all ourpackaging decisions as food waste is arguably a bigger threatto the environment than packaging waste, with a bigger carbonfootprint. While there are plastic-free options available, many ofthem dont keep our food fresh resulting in food waste and anincrease in carbon footprint compared to our existing packaging.Last year, Weetabix developed a model that predicts the effect ofdifferent materials on food waste, and it has been successful inhelping select materials to trial. We remain committed to doing allthe due diligence to find the best environmental solutions to keepthe impact of our packaging low. Were working all the timeto optimize the materials weuse in our packaging so thatwe achieve the best balance ofproduct protection and lowestimpact. This helps makeprogress on the sustainabilityfront, but it also ensuresour business operates asefficiently as we can.Mark TyrrellWeetabix Packaging Development ManagerRESPONSIBLE MARKETINGPost produces a wide portfolio of products that meet a varietyof consumer needs including value, taste, availability, nutritionand sustainability.

The packaging research anddevelopment teams are working to identify solutions to furtherclose the gap.Low-impact packaging is one of four strategic pillars of ourWeetabix Change for Better sustainability strategy. The focusis on reducing the overall impact of our packaging, which meanstaking a holistic view of all packaging choices and ensuring thatthey reduce waste and reduce emissions.Weetabix achieved 100% recyclability for all packaging, believingthis is the best option for its food-grade packaging. This wasachieved by successful changes, such as: Shifting to 100% recyclable bottles and reducing plastic by 10%for the Weetabix On The Go drinks range. Introducing an innovative new wrap for Weetabix, which is 100%recyclable in curbside collections.Many packaging innovations we are pursuing also result in carbonreductions. For example, the above two achievements alsoreduced our carbon footprint, removing 9% from our drinks rangeand 20% from Weetabix packaging.Food preservation also must remain front of mind in all ourpackaging decisions as food waste is arguably a bigger threatto the environment than packaging waste, with a bigger carbonfootprint. While there are plastic-free options available, many ofthem dont keep our food fresh resulting in food waste and anincrease in carbon footprint compared to our existing packaging.Last year, Weetabix developed a model that predicts the effect ofdifferent materials on food waste, and it has been successful inhelping select materials to trial. We remain committed to doing allthe due diligence to find the best environmental solutions to keepthe impact of our packaging low. Were working all the timeto optimize the materials weuse in our packaging so thatwe achieve the best balance ofproduct protection and lowestimpact. This helps makeprogress on the sustainabilityfront, but it also ensuresour business operates asefficiently as we can.Mark TyrrellWeetabix Packaging Development ManagerRESPONSIBLE MARKETINGPost produces a wide portfolio of products that meet a varietyof consumer needs including value, taste, availability, nutritionand sustainability.

President and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) serves on the Board of Directors and is frequently and directly engaged with our Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) Steering Committee, which oversees climate-related issues. Our President and CEO is regularly briefed on ESG and sustainability topics and progress by our ESG Senior Director and our ESG Steering Committee. Given carbon and climate change are an important topic for our key customers and investors, this topic is consistently included in briefings. TheThe ESG Steering Committee, which is led by our ESG Senior Director, includes leaders from global procurement, communications, legal, investor relations, and operations and reports directly to our Executive Vice President, General Counsel and Chief Administrative Officer.The ESG Steering Committee provides information and recommendations to the full Board of Directors, including climate-related risks and opportunities, at scheduled meetings and as important issues arise. As stated in our Corporate Governance Guidelines, The Board shall oversee matters relating to the Companys environmental, social and governance (ESG) practices and initiatives, as well as other social issues important to the Companysconstituents. The Board shall review the Companys annual or periodic ESG reports and consider significant ESG trends that may impact the Company. In addition, the Board Audit Committee Charter includes review information concerning environmental, legal, regulatory and other matters that may represent material financial exposure and/or material risk and appropriate management thereof. The ESG Steering Committee also routinely engages with the Presidents/CEOs from each of our operating companies.StrategyDisclose the actual and potential impacts of climate-related risks and opportunities on theorganizations businesses, strategy, and financial planning, including: a) Describe the climate related risks and opportunities the organization has identified over the short, medium and long term; b) Describe the impact of climate-related risks and opportunities on the organizations businesses, strategy and financial planning; and c) Describe the resilience of the organizations strategy, taking into consideration different climate-related scenarios, including a 2C or lower scenario.CDP Climate Change Questionnaire 2021 References: C2.1a, C2.3, C2.3a, C2.4, C2.4a, C3.2, C3.2a, C3.2b, C3.3, and C3.4Post maintains a TCFD-aligned global risk and opportunity assessment process that evaluates the relevancy of acute physical, chronic physical and transition and market risks and opportunities for our direct operations and supply chain. Our process for evaluating and monitoring climate-related risks and opportunities considers the following time horizons: short-term (0-2 years); medium-term (2-5 years); and long-term (5-10 years).For our baseline global assessment, we considered four distinct scenarios based upon a combination of physical and transition risks and the dynamics of average global warming degrees as described on page 28 of our 2022 ESG Report.The four scenarios are based upon a combination of physical and transition risks and the dynamics of average global warming degrees. If global temperatures go above 2C, the physical climate risks can be expected to be more frequent and intense. Conversely, if rapid decarbonization occurs through policies, regulations, innovation and consumer demand, then global temperatures will plateau or start to decrease, physical risks will lessen, and transition risks will become more dominant. It is also assumed that transition risks take a longer period forimplementation and impact, which results in scenarios that have medium- to long-term business implications.Additionally, it is expected scenario conditions will not be global and will vary by geography and time horizon (e.g., some geographies will accelerate decarbonization efforts faster than others). Posts approach is to evaluate the current and future relevance of these scenarios and monitoring changing conditions (e.g., a location moving from one scenario to a different one).Climate-related risks and opportunities are relevant to a consumer packaged goods companys entire value chain from raw material sourcing to the end of life or circularity for a given product. The impacts of physical and transition factors can influence our strategies, processes and decisions and can have both positive and potentially negative financial impacts. Our approach to climate adaptation and resiliency is based upon evaluating the following TCFD-defined opportunity categories as relevant to our company: Resource Efficiency: Pursuing more efficient raw material sourcing, production and transport. Energy Sourcing: Pursuing lower emission or renewable sources of energy. Products and Services: Responding to shifts in consumer preferences towards low carbon goods and services. Markets: Ability to access new and emerging markets due to more effective climate adaptation. Resilience: Pursuing enhanced business resiliency and ability to operate through various conditions and climate scenarios.From a climate risk perspective, over 75% of our production sites and approximately 90% of warehouse and distribution sites are exposed to a preferable scenario of low physical and low transition and market risks. Projecting into the future and the climate resiliency of our organization, it is possible that more of our production sites could be exposed to increased policy and market regulations and small number of sites could transition into a scenario of both higher physical and higher transition and market risks. Post Holdings is in the process of further evaluating our raw material sourcing from direct and indirect suppliers following a similar four-scenario method. Based upon our production sites being in Canada, the United States and the United Kingdom, we expected that the risk profile of our raw material sourcing will be like that of our production and warehouse portfolios.ManagementDisclose how the organization identifies, assesses, and manages climate-related risks, including: a) Describe the organizations processes for identifying and assessing climate-related risks; b) Describe the organizations processes for managing climate-related risks; and c) Describe how processes for identifying, assessing and managing climate-related risks are integrated into the organizations overall risk management.CDP Climate Change Questionnaire 2021 References: C2.1, C2.1a, C2.2, and C2.2aPosts process for evaluating acute physical, chronic physical, and transition risks and opportunities uses location specific inputs from widely recognized, publicly available data sources and risk categories including the following:Data Sources World Resources Institute (WRI) Aqueduct WWF Water Risk Filter Department of Homeland Security FEMA National Risk Index Alliance for Zero Extinction Conservation International Biodiversity Hotspot Key Biodiversity Area (KBA) Partnership Energy Information Administration (EIA) Energy & Climate Intelligence Unit (ECIU) Net Zero Scorecard United Nations Framework Convention onClimate Change (UNFCC) Nationally DeterminedContributions (NDC) Registry Location-specific contextual data from varioussources (e.g., energy mix, utility renewableenergy targets, net metering status and carbonpricing mechanisms)",

In fiscal year 2022, Post developed our Scope 3 GHG emissions baseline using the spend-based method. Post remains committed to reducing Scope 3 emissions and setting a goal but has delayed public announcement pending relevant climate-related regulations expected to be finalized in early 2023. In preparation for setting a goal, we utilized our baseline Scope 3 emissions profile to benchmark the GHG programs of our key suppliers and goal options. Our Weetabix business continues to explore Science Based Targets and will set new 2030 targets in 2023 with an ambition of operating as a net zero business by 2050.2) Climate Resiliency: The Post Risk Management function oversees a comprehensive program to evaluate and mitigate risks to our business, assets and people including consideration of climate-related risks and resiliency. The program includes periodic internal and external, by our commercial insurance partner, assessments risk exposure and preparedness. This insight is utilized to prioritize further evaluations, develop or enhance business continuity plans, and where necessary implement insurance mechanisms.3) Transparency: Post is committed to disclosing our plans and progress related to climate risks and opportunities, including participation in the annual CDP Climate questionnaire, an annual ESG Report, maintaining information on our website and this TCFD index.",
