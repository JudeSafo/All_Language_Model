COMMUNITY                     38 WELCOME Welcome to Kellogg Company’s 2010 Corporate Responsibility Report.




This report, which covers calendar year 2010, is intended to provide information useful to our stakeholders, including our consumers, employees, customers, investors, business partners, community members, and governmental and nongovernmental organizations.

This report discusses Kellogg Company’s wholly and majority-owned operations and complements other information about Kellogg available on our company website (www.kelloggcompany.com), our nutrition website (www.kelloggsnutrition.com) and our various regional websites around the world. The report re- ceived extensive internal review by subject-matter experts and our Executive Leadership Team, composed of our top executives.

For this report, we used the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) G3 Guidelines, which provide a recommended framework and indicators for reporting. We are reporting at a GRI-checked application level of “B.” A GRI Index, which details the indicators covered and their locations in this report, is included online, at www. kelloggcompany.com/CR. (The text of the online and print versions of the report are otherwise identical.) More information on the G3 Guidelines and application levels is available at www.globalreporting.org.

We welcome feedback at corporateresponsibility@kellogg.com. For every person who submits feedback in 2011, Kellogg Company will make a one-time donation of $5 to the Global FoodBanking Network—up to $10,000. EXECUTIVE MESSAGE
W.K. Kellogg put his signature on every package of cereal to express his personal pledge to quality and nutrition.

I was elected to this position in December 2010 and began serving in January 2011, following a difficult year for Kellogg.   2015 environmental performance goals, particularly our waste reduc- The global recession has challenged our business, as it has many of our food industry peers. Yet we continue working to enhance our corporate responsibility efforts, and our com- mitments to our customers, our employees, our communities and the natural environment remain strong. We know this is the right thing to do for all of our stakeholders. Corporate responsibility has been a vital part of our heritage, dating back more than a century to our founder, W.K. Kel- logg, who had a strong commitment to nutrition, health and quality. His legacy still informs and inspires us in all we do, from the products we make to our community investments. The food industry continues to face ever-greater social chal- lenges, such as feeding a growing population, battling world hunger, improving nutrition and addressing the obesity epi- demic. These have been historically—and will continue to be—key concerns for Kellogg. Such social challenges are linked to global environmental challenges, which remain key concerns for Kellogg as well. For example, we’re more aggressively addressing the issue of water, and its important links to environmental and social problems ranging from climate change to public health. New projects we have undertaken in recent years are help- ing to make Kellogg an even better company—and an even better corporate citizen—and we’re seeing good outcomes from recent investments in each of our four pillar areas: mar- ketplace, environment, workplace and community. For example, we have been working to improve the nutri- tion credentials of our food. Indeed, the single biggest so- cietal impact we can have as a company is to make food KELLOGG CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY 2010 ACTIVITIES AT A GLANCE Kellogg Company is committed to building a stronger busi- ness while acting responsibly toward our customers and consumers, our employees, our communities and the envi- ronment.

The company uses this non-GAAP financial measure to inform management and investors on the amount of cash available for debt repayment, dividend distribution, acquisition opportunities and share repurchases. We have articulated our ambitions for each of our pillars, as follows:

We have a comprehensive, global corporate responsibility strategy to help guide our decisions in light of ever-changing environmental, social and economic conditions. The strategy, which we first developed in 2008 to consolidate our many existing efforts in these areas, aligns with our vision, mission and statement of purpose, which can be found at www.kelloggcompany.com. The strategy identified our major corporate responsibility issues based on a materiality analysis that defined the most important areas for both our company and our stakeholders.4 The material issues were grouped into four pillar areas—marketplace, workplace, environment and community. These areas continue to form the structure for this report and serve as the basis for the further development and implementation of our strategy.

Across the corporate responsibility pillars, we have created new programs and continued to engage with groups both within and outside our industry on key issues such as obesity and nutrition. Examples of these initiatives can be found throughout this report. We are also driving progress toward our environment pillar goals. We recognize setting goals and metrics in other pillars remains an opportunity. 4 Materiality is a familiar concept in financial accounting that has re- cently been applied to corporate responsibility as a way to focus a company’s efforts on those issues that pose the most significant risks and opportunities. The materiality analysis ranked corporate re- sponsibility issues qualitatively along three parameters: level of soci- etal interest and concern, impact on Kellogg (based on financial and reputational impact) and level of control. The issues deemed most material are those that are of high societal concern and impact on Kellogg, and over which the company has some degree of control. For these issues, we seek to understand the risks and opportunities they pose for our company, our role in addressing them and stake- holders’ expectations for our actions.

COMMUNITY CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY GOVERNANCE AND MANAGEMENT
Strategic Corporate Philanthropy Community Development Employee Volunteerism

We have a corporate responsibility governance structure that outlines accountability for driving progress toward our corporate responsibility strategy. This structure integrates the management of our material issues into our mainstream business processes. At the Board of Directors level, we have a Social Responsibil- ity Committee composed of four members, all of whom are independent. The committee, which has been in existence since 1979, met twice in 2010 and oversees all aspects of our corporate responsibility approach. Other committees of the Board address corporate responsibility issues as well. For example, the Audit Committee reviews environmental performance. The Board as a whole also addresses key issues discussed in this report, including many relating to health and nutrition. At the senior executive level, our chief sustainability officer reports directly to the chief executive officer.

The K Values™ shape our culture, serve as our social contract and guide the way a culture is the commitment of corporate leadership, par- ticularly at the Board and senior management levels. Kellogg employees at all levels take the K Values™ seriously, and we refer to them regularly in our work. Most of our new em- ployees take part in an orientation program — customized to each location — that includes training in the K Values™. This ensures that all employees understand what those values are and how to put them into practice. In addition, employee performance reviews take into account employees’ adher- ence to and demonstration of the K Values™. STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT

Our Global Code of Ethics guides the business practices of all Kellogg employees worldwide. Nearly all employees with access to company computers complete annual Compliance and Ethics Training, which is conducted in 13 languages and has been in place since 2000. We also distribute paper- based training to our sales employees. In 2010, we implemented changes to our online ethics and compliance training program to continue improving its rele- vance to the Kellogg business. In addition, employees now participate in four shorter, quarterly training programs, rather   found online at www.kelloggcompany.com. than one longer, annual course.

RESPONSIBLE SOURCING In 2010, we fully implemented our Global Sup- plier Code of Conduct, further embedding it into our supplier relationships. For information on our responsible sourcing strategies, please see the Marketplace section of this report. MARKETPLACE At Kellogg, we take pride in producing great-tasting products that are safe, wholesome and high quality and that satisfy a variety of consumer preferences. Our company is on a continuous journey to improve the nutrition credentials of our foods, without compromising taste or quality. As consumer expectations about foods evolve and as government regula- tions shift, we look for ways our company can take a leadership role within the food industry—from how we source our ingredients to how we label, market and sell our products.




SINCE OUR LAST REPORT

Since our previous report was published in April 2010, we have worked to advance our efforts in nutrition, product marketing and labeling, food safety and responsible sourcing. For example, we: • Announced a 15 percent sugar reduction program for our popular Coco Pops® cereals in the United Kingdom. • Lowered sodium in select popular cereals in several markets, including Europe and Canada, as part of an overall product reformulation initiative that has reduced the average amount of sodium per serving in our ready-to-eat cereals in our core mar- kets by 13 percent from 2007 through 2010.
The major topics discussed in this section include: • NUTRITION AND HEALTH • RESPONSIBLE MARKETING • CONSUMER INFORMATION AND LABELING • PRODUCT QUALITY AND FOOD SAFETY • RESPONSIBLE SOURCING • CHALLENGES WE FACE • WHERE WE ARE GOING

• Participated in the Healthy Weight Commitment Foundation (a coalition of 100+ food companies and other stakeholders), which pledged to collectively remove 1.5 trillion calories from members’ U.S. products by the end of 2015.

• Joined with leading food and beverage manufacturers to develop a new front-of- package nutrition labeling system in the United States, supported through an indus- try-led multi-million-dollar consumer education campaign.

• Joined with leading food manufacturers in Canada to partner with Health Canada on a nutrition labeling education initiative.

• Further embedded our Global Supplier Code of Conduct into our supplier relationships. NUTRITION AND HEALTH Our founder, W.K. Kellogg, dedicated his company to mak- ing “quality products for a healthier world.” That vision con- tinues to guide our commitment to producing high-quality and nutritious foods that meet individual dietary needs and taste preferences.

We continue to study emerging sub- stitutes and will consider including them in our products if extensive tests prove they are safe and reliable.

In 2010, we continued our focus on innovating new products and renovating existing brands, reducing “negatives,” such as sodium and sugar, and increasing “positives,” such as fiber and essential vitamins and minerals. As we continue to reformulate our products, we are commit- ted to aggressively pursuing sodium and sugar reductions without compromising taste. In the U.K., for example, we announced a program to deliver a 15 percent sugar reduc- tion in our Coco Pops® cereals. We plan to further lower the sugar content in our Coco Pops® products in the U.K. market, provided they pass consumer taste tests, and we are looking at ways to replicate these types of sugar reduc- tions in other markets. In terms of sodium, from 2007 through 2010 we reduced the average amount of sodium per serving in our ready-to-eat cereals in our core markets1 by 13 percent. We had a num- ber of notable examples of sodium reductions in 2010. In

As we look at ways to refine our nutrition strategy, we are focusing on product renovations and innovations that increase positives (such as fiber), reduce sugar and salt, and eliminate ingredients such as hydrogenated fats. We’ve been making great strides in these areas. As one of the world’s leading food producers, we can have a big impact on consumer health by making even “ small nutrition improvements in our foods. Typically, consumers aren’t aware that we’ve made an improve- ment, such as a sodium reduction, because we have done it in a way that does not change the taste.

4 5 The Dietary Guidelines for Americans, which are reviewed by a scientific panel every five years, contain the latest science-based nutritional and dietary guidance for the general public. The Guidelines provide the foundation for federal nutrition-education and promotion programs, as well as the basis for federal food-assistance programs. THE OBESITY CHALLENGE During 2010, concern about obesity continued to increase, as reflected, for example, in First Lady Michelle Obama’s Let’s Move campaign to curb childhood obesity through calorie reductions and increased exercise. Approximately 20 percent of children in the U.S. are obese, while about one- third are overweight.6 We believe that all foods have a place in the diet, with bal- ance and moderation, and, when coupled with exercise, can be part of a healthy lifestyle. Kellogg is playing a role in the Healthy Weight Commitment Foundation (HWCF), a coalition of more than 100 retailers, food and beverage manufactur- ers and nongovernmental organizations, among others. This first-of-its-kind initiative, which Kellogg fully supports, pledged in 2010 to remove 1.5 trillion calories from coalition members’ U.S. products by the end of 2015, using foods and beverages available in 2008 as a baseline. Kellogg and other HWCF food manufacturers are pursuing calorie-reduction goals by developing and introducing lower- calorie options, changing existing recipes where possible to lower calorie content, and reducing the portion sizes of ex- isting single-serve products. Kellogg is helping to develop similar coalitions in other parts of the world. In France, Kellogg has been a strong supporter of EPODE— the full name of which translates to “Together Let’s Prevent Childhood Obesity”—a public-private partnership that en- courages healthier lifestyles. In 2010, we contributed about $135,000 to the organization. Launched in 2003, EPODE now extends to nearly 1.8 million residents in 167 cities in France, as well as 20 cities in Spain and eight in Belgium. 6 The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention determine overweight and obesity ranges for adults using weight and height to calculate a number called the “body mass index” (BMI). BMI is used because it typically correlates with a person’s amount of body fat. An adult who has a BMI between 25 and 29.9 is considered overweight. An adult with a BMI of 30 or higher is considered obese. 7 Sources for obesity statistics: The International Obesity Task Force and the World Health Organization. RESPONSIBLE MARKETING

Kellogg has pledged to responsibly market our products and communicate their intrinsic qualities so that buyers can make informed choices.

Our Worldwide Marketing and Communication Guidelines (WWMCG) provide a consistent global framework for respon- sible marketing practices. They guide our advertising and marketing approach for digital and traditional media, in-school activities, licensed property use, contests and promotions, in addition to the related areas of privacy protection, e-commerce and other media. In 2010, we began revisions to the WWMCG, including updates to stay current with our envi- ronmental marketing guidelines and rapidly evolving forms of social media. The WWMCG will include our new corporate guidelines for “green marketing” claims and iconography, such as packaging- reduction statements, that appear on our product packages and related literature. In the U.S., the Federal Trade Commis- sion (FTC) in 2010 proposed revisions to its own “green guides”   around the world. to help companies avoid making misleading environmental sustainability statements.

SENSITIVE INGREDIENTS

Over the last two years, we have created new internal teams to audit suppliers of sensitive, high-risk ingredients, such as nuts and seeds, dried fruits and vegetables, and chocolate. During 2010, our audit teams visited each sensitive ingre- dient supplier in the U.S.—approximately 100 suppliers in total—to ensure they are maintaining our high standards.

We are also expanding our internal auditing teams to audit all suppliers—not just those of sensitive ingredients. Currently, these suppliers are required to conduct their own quality and safety testing. While this is a common industry practice, we intend to further strengthen our approach. INDUSTRY PARTICIPATION

Kellogg is a member of or active participant in a number of key industry groups that focus on food quality and safety, including:


• The Association of Food and Drug Officials

• The Grocery Manufacturers Association

• The International Association of Food Protection

• The International Life Sciences Institute


We are proud to be a member of the University of Geor- gia’s Center for Food Safety and actively participate in their meetings, support applied research in food safety and present scientific papers.

AUDITING STANDARDS We voluntarily participate in the Global Food Safety Initia- tive, or GFSI, a set of industry standards launched in 2000 to improve food-safety management systems throughout the supply chain. External GFSI audits provide a basis for con- sistency for the industry. Today, nearly all of our manufacturing plants and co-man- ufacturing facilities are GFSI certified. We will require GFSI certification for all ingredient suppliers as of June 30, 2011.

These five- to seven-day audits are conducted at all of our Kellogg manu- facturing facilities globally.

We have teams of Kellogg auditors who evaluate our co-manufacturing plants at least annually as part of our stringent supplier quality audit process. COALESCING TOWARD SUCCESS: MINORITY SUPPLIER DEVELOPMENT AT KELLOGG
OSITION ON NANOTECHNOLOGY
Nanotechnology is an enabling technology that will im- pact medicine, cosmetics, agriculture, food and food packaging. The FDA has not established its own for- mal definition for a nano particle, which can potentially cause changes in the physical, chemical and biological properties of a material. Kellogg does not use nano materials.

In 2003, a young African-American food scientist named Angela Cauley decided to launch her own company for blended spices and seasonings. Less than a decade later, Coalescence, LLC, sells more than $21 million worth of custom flavorings each year to Kellogg and other major food companies and restaurant chains.

The company’s rapid success was a mixture of good timing, hard work—and some pivotal support from Kellogg Company’s supplier diversity program. In Coalescence’s early days, we saw the potential for the minority-owned company to thrive. Kellogg provided a scholarship for Cauley to attend business school and hone her skills.

In addition, Kellogg gave Cauley and her team the benefit of our professional expertise to help her business grow. For example, we sent several of our quality and food safety employees to the Columbus, Ohio-based company to coach her staff on industry best practices. We also worked with Cauley and her husband and business partner, Ian Blount, on a long-term financial growth strategy.

Coalescence’s sales exploded between 2008 and 2009, jumping 760 percent from $2.5 million in annual sales to $21.5 million. Today, Coalescence is the sole supplier of seasonings to our MorningStar Farms® line of meatless products—an appropriate fit for Cauley, who is a vegetarian. “Our company couldn’t have grown like it did if it weren’t for patience and support from Kellogg,” Cauley said. “They put us on the map, and they gave us the ability to develop our business into so much more than we had imagined.”
Angela Cauley Ian Blount Owners / Coalescence, LLC

At Kellogg, we want diverse suppliers like Coalescence to grow and evolve with us. We look for ways to equip these companies with the tools they need—from ideas to resources to procurement dollars—to stay competitive and strong. “Our supplier diversity program is about more than simply boosting the numbers of minority-owned companies in our supply chain,” said Cathy K.9, director of supplier relations and diversity at Kellogg. “It’s about partnering with companies to foster mutual success.”

RESPONSIBLE SOURCING

Ensuring an ethical supply chain is an essential part of our sourcing strategy. We want customers to feel confident that the ingredients that go into our products are sourced responsibly. Our Responsible Sourcing Framework focuses on four key areas: business ethics, labor standards, employee safety and health, and the environment. A primary com- ponent of this framework is our Global Supplier Code of Conduct, which requires compliance with applica- ble fair labor practices and business ethics, as well as pertinent environmental, health and safety standards.

CHALLENGES WE FACE
WHERE WE ARE GOING

Many of the challenges we face are ones we can’t tackle alone—issues such as an increasingly obese population and a safe and secure supply chain. We’re continuing to look at ways we can make a difference by partnering with industry, retailers, governments and nongovernmental organizations. But system-wide changes don’t happen overnight.
Looking ahead, we will continue to search for innovative ways to improve the nutrition credentials of our foods without compromising taste and quality. Our aim is always to provide choices that allow consumers to select the foods that are right for them. We will also remain focused on continuously improving the safety and integrity of the products we make.

We are a responsible food manufacturer in each of our regions, following local guidelines for nutrition, marketing and labeling. Ultimately, everything we do ties back to our global nutri- tion policy, which expresses our commitment to providing great-tasting choices that help consumers meet their nutri- tion needs.
WORKPL ACE Our founder, W.K. Kellogg, said: “Whatever success I have had in business has been a result of my good fortune in selecting employees who could do their jobs better than I could have done them myself.” More than a century later, we know that employees remain our most important resource. Our success today and tomorrow depends on them.

At Kellogg, we maintain high workplace standards at all of our locations worldwide. We aim to ensure a safe working environment, adhere to compensation and employment laws and regulations, and ensure that our employees have the right to choose whether or not to be represented by a union. We have not identified any Kellogg-owned opera- tions at which the right of freedom of association is at risk or at which child labor or forced labor are a risk. We work hard to maintain strong, positive relationships with our employees. Our corporate Labor Relations department supports all employee relations and union relations in North America. Outside North America, the corporate Labor Rela- tions office collaborates with its international counterparts in our other regions to share best practices. About 36 percent of Kellogg Company’s global workforce is represented by unions. During 2010, we negotiated 23 collective bargaining agreements covering more than 1,600 workers in the U.S. and Canada. We conduct regular audits at our manufacturing and dis- tribution locations to ensure compliance with regulatory requirements and Kellogg policies in such areas as pay- roll, hiring practices, benefits administration and other em- ployment practices. We also occasionally conduct external audits in areas such as the administration of benefits and payroll, to confirm our compliance.

Kellogg also requires ethical employment practices throughout our supply chain. Beginning in 2010, the ma- jority of suppliers signing new or revised contracts with Kellogg must attest, in those contracts, that their practices align with our Global Supplier Code of Conduct. This Code states that we expect suppliers to treat their employees with fairness, respect and dignity, and to promote a work environment that is free of harassment, forced labor, cor- poral punishment and other forms of physical coercion. It also requires that suppliers ensure child labor is not used in any operation. See the Marketplace section for more on our Global Supplier Code of Conduct. We are working to ensure diversity and inclusion globally as well. For example, Kellogg Latin America conducted a 3½- day training program for our Latin American Leadership Team that focused on the full acceptance and inclusion of workers from all economic backgrounds. In Canada, we launched a new Kellogg Canada Diversity and Inclusion Council. Led by Canadian employees, the Council’s mission is to sup- port and promote a diverse and inclusive culture across our Canadian business. And in Australia and New Zealand, we sponsored a series of “lunch and learn” seminars to provide women an opportunity to network and learn strategies for advancing their careers at Kellogg. In the U.S. we sponsor six Employee Resource Groups (ERGs)—one each for our African-American, Latino, LGBT, multinational, female and young professional employees. The ERGs are open to all employees, and participation is voluntary. More than 2,600 people take part in these groups, which offer support, networking and development opportunities.

The ERGs assist with recruiting and retention and, increas- ingly, are contributing directly to business results. For exam- ple, our Latino and African-American ERGs recently assisted with market research by providing feedback on television advertising geared toward consumers from these ethnic groups. The effort helped Kellogg gain a richer understand- ing of these consumer segments and how we can most ef- fectively communicate with them.
DIVERSITY TRAINING FOR U.S. EMPLOYEES

In 2004, we had a low representation of women in our Supply Chain function, especially at the higher levels. So, the company launched a program to increase female employees’ opportunities for networking, training and ad- vancement. (At Kellogg, when we talk about our organizational structure, ‘Supply Chain’ refers to our manufactur- ing operations and related depar tments, such as customer logistics services and procurement. It doesn’t relate to our suppliers.)

Debbie M. Senior Vice President,
Called Women in Supply Chain, or WiSC, this voluntary program was created to enhance the success of women in Supply Chain and to foster leadership skills, offer professional development opportunities, enable networking and engage senior leadership in helping to overcome the barriers facing women, so that we would ultimately have better representation of women at all levels. WiSC now brings together salaried women from our Supply Chain function in the U.S. and Canada to participate in regional workshops and plant tours each year. It has been a big success. In fact, the company views WiSC as one of the main factors behind the increasing num-

I’ve been with Kellogg for 16 years and have been very fortunate to serve in a number of interesting roles. It’s a privilege for me to be involved with WiSC and to be a part of helping women develop professionally and have even greater impact within our company. I’m a strong believer that leveraging the diversity of our workforce makes us a stronger Kellogg Company and enhances our success. And I think this program is really helping us to do that.

In 2010 in the U.S., we secured a new vendor to launch an integrated total health management plan. This plan allows us to take a more holistic approach to disease and life- style management with our employees. It builds upon our Feeling G-r-reat™ program by offering a broad suite of well- ness initiatives, including smoking cessation, diet and exer- cise programs and chronic disease management. The new platform will also allow our wellness program to expand to include employee spouses, domestic partners and retirees. In 2012, we hope to expand participation beyond the U.S. Outside of the U.S., wellness programs have been developed to support local market needs. Programs range from annual health screenings to recreational sports leagues. In Mexico, A number of Kellogg facilities around the world have achieved outstanding worker safety success in recent years. Among them is our cereal plant in Anseong, South Korea. The Anseong plant’s 75 employees have not had a lost time injury nor a total recordable injury since late 2008. Kelvin H., director of quality and technology for Kellogg Asia Pacific, attributes Anseong’s success to both physical improvements in the plant and positive engagement with the workforce on safety issues.
for example, our Linares plant sponsored an “environment and health week” in June 2010, during which employees could undergo health screenings and take part in seminars on office ergonomics, fire extinguisher usage and other topics. To better align our retirement benefits with current indus- try practice in the U.S. and to remain competitive, we have replaced our defined benefit pension plans with an enhanced 401(k) plan for salaried and non-union hourly employees hired after Jan. 1, 2010. The new plan provides greater control, visibility and flexibility for employees to manage their retirement funds. In addition, we made new resources and tools available to employees to assist with 1 Note that, generally, all of our salaried, non-union employees in the U.S. who work more than 20 hours per week are eligible for em- ployee benefits. South Korea Plant Ranks Among Kellogg Company’s Top Employee Safety Performers

“Over the past three years, the Anseong facility has made continual capital investments to the plant to improve safety,” Kelvin said. “For example, they have installed improved guarding technology on the packaging and processing machinery to prevent injuries. They also reduced risk to staff from moving equipment by marking out clear paths in key areas and installing separating hand rails.”

But Kelvin sees the plant’s employee engagement efforts as pivotal. “At the beginning of each shift,” he explained, “the employees participate in a discussion on the daily safety theme, and they make a verbal commitment to look out for each other’s safety over the next eight hours. This team-oriented approach has been very effective.” The plant also holds regular safety committee meet- ings and invests in safety training sessions delivered by outside specialists.

The graphic (on the previous page) shows the other Kellogg manufacturing facilities, office locations and distribution centers that achieved outstanding safety results in 2010. Seven of our manufacturing sites have had no LTIs for the past three years running. And in the U.S., 13 of our distribution centers have gone more 1,000 days since their last LTI, and nine distribution centers have gone more than 500 days without any recordable injury at all.




retirement planning. Our defined benefit plans for employees hired before Jan. 1, 2010, remain fully funded with trust as- sets invested in a globally diversified portfolio. Outside of the U.S., the company has undertaken similar ef- forts to align our retirement benefits with local market prac- tices and provide education, as permitted by regulations, to assist with retirement planning.

In addition, we will work to de- velop and integrate a consistent global employee “brand” workplace-related measures, such as employee demograph- ics. Using the data gleaned, we hope to have more diversity metrics and other statistics to share in the future. In addition, we plan to conduct our periodic employee opinion survey in 2011, and the findings will be shared in our next report.

We remain wholly committed to attracting and retaining tal- ented employees. With our values-driven culture and our strong commitments to positive labor relations, diversity, tal- ent development, workplace safety and employee wellness, we feel confident we will continue to be seen as an “em- ployer of choice” in the communities in which we operate. ENVIRONMENT As a global food company, natural resources are at the core of our business. We rely on agricultural systems for our food ingredients; we use energy and water in our manufacturing operations; and our packaging is made primarily from paperboard (most of it recycled). Clearly, we have a stake in helping to ensure a healthy environment and abundant natural resources for generations to come. That’s why we are committed to conducting our business in a way that reduces our environmental impact.

1 Due to improved data analysis, our previously reported data for energy use, GHG emissions, water use and waste for the years 2005 to 2009 have been slightly revised and restated in this report. ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT The Social Responsibility Committee of our Board of Direc- tors oversees the company’s sustainability efforts and cli- mate policy. All four committee members are independent. At the executive level, environmental issues are overseen by our chief sustainability officer, who is a member of our Executive Leadership Team and reports to our president and CEO. A vice president for environmental stewardship, health and safety is responsible for those areas globally. Each Kellogg plant around the world has reduction goals for energy use, GHG emissions, water use and waste sent to landfill. The plants report monthly on progress, and manag- ers’ performance reviews and bonuses are based, in part, on their facilities’ performance compared to the targets.
OUR GOALS FOR 2015 2 • Reduce our energy use, GHG emissions and water use by 15-20 percent (per metric tonne of food produced), using 2005 as a baseline. • Continue to reduce our waste sent to landfill (per met- ric tonne of food produced) beyond the 51 percent al- ready reduced since 2005.

In 2010 we implemented a new environmental and safety management software system called K-CAPP (Kellogg Cares About People and Planet). K-CAPP standardizes audit and compliance management relating to environmen- tal and occupational health and safety programs, as well as incident management and reporting, at all Kellogg sites globally. K-CAPP is fully aligned with ISO 14001 and 18001, the widely recognized global standards for environmental and health and safety management.
INDUSTRY COMMITS TO ZERO NET DEFORESTATION Established in 2009, the Consumer Goods Forum (CGF) is a global industry association of more than 650 retail- ers, manufacturers and other businesses in the consumer goods industry. Kellogg is a member of the CGF.

Also in 2010 we updated our global standards—and intro- duced several new ones—relating to environmental perfor- mance. The new standards cover topics such as land use management and energy conservation, among others. As of December 2010, five Kellogg facilities were ISO 14001 certified. In Mexico, our Linares and Toluca plants received Industria Limpia (“clean industry”) certifications in 2010 from PROFEPA, Mexico’s federal environmental protection agen- cy.
Sustainability is one of the CGF’s five strategic priorities, and the association has made commitments relating to four sustainability-related issues: carbon measurement, refrigeration, packaging and deforestation. On the latter issue, the CGF Board pledged in November 2010 to “mobilize resources within our respective busi- nesses to help achieve zero net deforestation by 2020.” This pledge focuses on the major contributors to tropical deforestation: the cultivation of palm and soy, logging for paper and board, and the raising of cattle and other livestock. Member companies have agreed to achieve this goal via individual company initiatives and by working collectively in partnership with governments and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs). At Kellogg, we have limited, if any, exposure to soy, paper or livestock products derived from tropical deforested land. Palm oil is a more challenging issue; we discuss it in the Environment section.

2 Note that our goals and metrics are for Kellogg-owned facilities only. Also, “metric tonne of food” is a measurement of actual food product, not including packaging. ENERGY AND GREENHOUSE GASES
We look forward to continuing our work with the CGF and our fellow member companies to drive progress on these and other important sustainability issues. RISKS AND OPPORTUNITIES

We consider energy use and its associated GHG emissions to be our most significant environmental impacts.3 Our man- ufacturing facilities and transportation fleets are powered by   logg. Our climate change risks may be regulatory, financial fossil fuels, which release GHGs when burned. Our suppliers also require energy to create the food ingredients, equipment and packaging material we purchase. Kellogg has completed “carbon footprint” assessments for several products in different countries and across dif- ferent product categories. This work confirmed that more than half of our products’ lifecycle carbon emissions occur in the raw materials supply chain. A sample carbon footprint assessment for products made in our U.K. manufacturing plants is shown below.4

Note that our overall energy and GHG data does not include emissions from our non-U.S. ware- houses, offices or fleet. deed, many experts believe that the effects of climate change will be felt most keenly in terms of water supply disruptions such as drought and flooding. Kellogg Company’s largest water impact occurs in our agri- cultural supply chain. In 2009 we conducted water footprint assessments for several of our cereals; these revealed that agriculture accounts for more than 95 percent of the water used during their lifecycles. The remaining volumes include water used in our manufacturing processes (e.g., for clean- ing and cooling) and as an ingredient in our products. In 2010, the CDP launched a new Water Disclosure program, and Kellogg was proud to be among the first companies in the world to submit information to it. Our submission report details our water use and the physical, financial and regula- tory risks our company could face in the event of water scar- city and/or water-quality degradation.

water used for manufacturing must meet quality standards, which in some locations already requires the treatment of incoming water prior to use. This has direct cost and labor impacts, as well as the potential to limit production capacity. We have plans in place to address these kinds of business risks, through water conservation programs in line with our water-efficiency goal.
14.0% Since 2005, our water use per metric tonne of food produced decreased 14.0 percent.

Our water-reduction performance—shown in the charts above right—is the result of myriad water-efficiency efforts at our facilities worldwide. Our cereal plant in South Africa, for example, achieved a 12 percent reduction in water use in 2010, compared to 2009. This progress was achieved by changing from wet to dry cleaning methods during their cleaning shutdowns.
KELLOGG CONDUCTS WATER RISK ASSESSMENT In June 2010, we launched a global water risk assessment process using the World Business Council on Sustain- able Development’s Global Water Tool. The purpose of the assessment was to give us insight into where, when and how we face risks related to water availability and quality. The results from the assessment will help us identify and prioritize facility-specific, water-related business risks, monitor projected trends and evaluate regional conditions.

WASTE At Kellogg, we continually seek ways to reduce waste. We’re pleased to report that we’ve made excellent progress this past year in reducing our waste sent to landfill. (See chart below.) By 2009, Kellogg had exceeded its original target of reduc- ing waste to landfill (per metric tonne of food produced) by 20 percent. (From 2005 to 2009 we achieved a 36 percent actual reduction in waste sent to landfill, which equated to a 42 percent reduction per metric tonne of food produced.) We therefore set a new goal – to further reduce waste to landfill by an additional 20 percent from 2010 to 2015, using 2009 as our baseline. We are extremely proud to report that we have already exceeded that goal as well; we reduced waste sent to landfill by 20.3 percent (per metric tonne of food produced) since 2009. We continue to strive for zero waste to landfill, while continuing to reduce the amount of waste going to landfill from our operations. We achieved this performance through a variety of projects and activities at each of our facilities.
For each Kellogg facility, we assessed watershed stress, incoming water flow, incoming water quality, wastewater discharge, water cost, regulatory pressures and facility water management. Our preliminary results were validated by external subject-matter experts in each region. We also assessed key ingredient supplies and associated water- related business risks, overlaying our supply source locations against water stress indicators in order to prioritize further risk assessment efforts and engagement with suppliers. SINCE 2005 Our Taloja plant in India reduced its food and packaging waste in 2010 by 67 percent. We achieved this success by first collecting thorough baseline waste data and analyzing areas for improvement, and then implementing waste-reduc- 51% ing process enhancements throughout the plant.

Our plant in Manchester, England, has decreased its waste sent to landfill by 88 percent in the past three years, largely by changing the onsite waste management contractor from a waste-disposal company to a waste-recycling company. This has ensured that as much waste as possible is segre- gated and sent for reuse, recycling and composting. In the U.S., our plants in Omaha, Neb.; Battle Creek, Mich.; and Seelyville, Ind., achieved good results by installing addi- tional balers so that items formerly thrown out can be easily toted away for recycling. Together these facilities achieved an average 59 percent reduction in waste to landfill over their 2009 totals. All told, seven North American plants achieved more than a 30 percent reduction in waste sent to landfill in 2010.

Less than 7 percent of our overall waste ends up in a landfill. Twenty-four Kellogg facilities in 12 dif- ferent countries currently send less than 5 percent of the waste they generate to landfill.

At Kellogg, we define sustainable packaging as packaging that is designed to have the least possible impact on the environment at efficient costs, while delivering a safe, high- quality product to our consumers. Almost all Kellogg Com- pany’s cereal cartons are made of 100 percent recycled fiber, with at least 35 percent from consumer-recycled material. In fact, we are one of the largest users of recycled paperboard in the U.S. We estimate that packaging amounts to about 15 to 20 percent of our products’ lifecycle carbon footprint.

Paul pointed to the successful 2010 redesign of a group of 16 products, all of them cartons of 100-calorie snack pouches. By redesigning the pouches, the cartons and the corrugated cases, Kellogg designers decreased the loaded onto each truck for delivery,” Paul explained. “We avoided about 200 truck trips in 2010 as a result of this one redesign. That of course also decreased our fossil fuel use and GHG emissions.”

Other top-performing redesigns of snack foods in 2010 resulted in package-to-product ratio reductions of 18, 12 and 8 percent, respectively. Paul estimates that about 15 percent of Kellogg snack products underwent redesigns in 2010.

Asked what drove Kellogg to achieve these improvements, Paul noted two contributing factors. “We have a robust cost-saving program in place,” he said. “That’s certainly a part of it. But these kinds of improvements are also valued for their contributions to our overall corporate responsibility commitment.”

Other business units in the company are also pursuing packaging reduc- tions when they do product redesigns. The Snacks team has thus far shown the most success, in part due to its wide range of products and types of packaging.

Palm oil is used in a wide array of consumer goods, including foods, soaps, cos- metics and more. Kellogg Company uses approximately 0.1 percent of the global supply of palm oil annually, and it is a small percentage of our total ingredients. As a socially responsible company, however, concerns about the sustainable produc- tion of palm oil are clearly on our radar screen. While the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) continues to work toward the development of a consistent and sufficient supply of segregated, sustainably grown palm oil, such a supply is cur- rently not available in the U.S. or our other markets outside of Europe. (In Europe, some segregated, sustainably grown palm oil is available, but not in the form we need for our products.)

Once a segregated supply is available that is financially and logistically feasible, we will move to sustainable palm oil. In the meantime, Kellogg announced in early 2011 that we are helping growers fund the transition to sustainable palm oil by increasing our purchase of Green Palm certificates to now cover 100 percent of our global palm oil use. “By supporting sustainable production in this way, Kellogg is demonstrating just the sort of responsible action that we want others to take,” said Jason W. Clay, Ph.D., senior vice president of the World Wildlife Fund. “As the first in   HOSTS TWO MULTI-STAKEHOLDER the U.S. food industry to take this step, they’re setting an example for others to follow.” We are also helping to reduce deforestation from palm oil production by: • Only purchasing palm oil from suppliers that are members of the RSPO. And as members ourselves, Kellogg is also helping to promote the growth and use of sustainable palm oil. With this group and other stakeholders, we continue to explore solutions to this global issue. • Encouraging our blended palm oil suppliers to continue to increase the percentage of sustainable palm oil in the supplies they purchase, as the available supply increases. • Through our Global Supplier Code of Conduct, requiring our vendor partners to commit to reducing their impact on the environment. Finally, as discussed previously, the Consumer Goods Forum pledged in late 2010 to mobilize their collective re- sources to help achieve zero net deforestation by 2020. Kellogg is a member of the Consumer Goods Forum and supports this commitment.

We also worked to make fewer, but more targeted, donations that have greater impact and broader reach. For example, we: • Donated $32 million in cash and products to charitable organizations worldwide. • Continued to donate food to food banks and programs around the world. • Contributed to breakfast programs that provided millions of morning meals to schoolchildren around the globe. • Supported a downtown revitalization project in our headquarters city of Battle Creek, Mich.

HUNGER RELIEF

At Kellogg, we view nutrition, wellness and well being as in- tertwined, and we seek to support charitable initiatives that promote a healthier world. For that reason, we focus our strategic philanthropy programs on nutrition and malnutri- tion, physical fitness, and community development. We also support initiatives that expand opportunities for people of diverse backgrounds. (Diversity programs are discussed in the Workplace section of this report.) In 2010, we contributed more than $13 million in cash, in- cluding brand philanthropy, and $19 million in products to nonprofits and charitable organizations around the world. Our goal is to donate the equivalent of 2 to 2.5 percent of pre-tax, annual profits to worthy social causes. This includes cash donations equal to half a percent of pre-tax profits and in-kind product donations equal to 1.5 to 2 percent of pre- tax profits. In addition, individual brands may support charitable initia- tives that are of interest to consumers. Typically, a brand will make a financial contribution during a specified time period for an identified cause.

of our primary partners for hunger relief is the Global FoodBanking Network (GFN), which creates, supplies and engthens food banks and food bank networks around the world.

logg Company helped found the GFN in 2006. Since then, the network has witnessed rapid growth, with food banks 18 countries now supplying hungry individuals with nutritious food.

example, thanks to the efforts of the GFN, Mexico now has more than 60 food banks serving more than 1 million ple. In South Africa, four national food banks are supplying more than 1,100 local food organizations and programs. food banking is taking root in India and is continuing to develop in Indonesia and throughout Central and South rica. Kellogg has supplied food, cash donations, technical assistance and leadership to this growing movement.




BREAKFAST PROGRAMS

CEREAL PROMOTION BENEFITS ACTION FOR HEALTHY KIDS

In early 2011, Kellogg launched a new, six-month program to increase awareness of the importance of breakfast and benefit Action for Healthy Kids. “Share Your Breakfast” asks consumers to post photographs of their break- fasts to www.ShareYourBreakfast.com. For each submission of a photo or description of a breakfast, Kellogg will help increase participation in school breakfast programs through Action for Healthy Kids. The goal is to help share 1 million breakfasts during the 2011-2012 school year. Our county has the highest rate of unemployment and foreclosures in Minnesota, and severe poverty is an issue for many of our students. As educators, we recognize the fundamental link between good nutri- tion—especially breakfast—and strong academic performance. Yet, many of the pupils at Ogilvie were coming to school on empty stomachs.

did something very simple, yet incredibly powerful: We purchased carts for our staff to deliver breakfasts directly to students in their classrooms. Thanks to this program, 75 percent of Ogilvie students now eat a nutritious breakfast during their ‘morning meeting’ time before classes begin—a 90 percent increase over the previous year. The breakfasts them- selves are paid for by the federal government.

Programs like these demonstrate that even modest amounts of financial assistance can yield big benefits for some of our country’s neediest children.

We have also helped to launch breakfast clubs in Australia, Belgium, Germany, Sweden and New Zealand, and we’re currently working to establish programs in Spain and Ire- land. In all of our clubs, we focus our support on the needi- est communities and partner with local groups to make the programs successful.

We look for ways to support the communities where our em- ployees live and work. Some recent examples include the following: • Kellogg’s Corn Flakes® Field of Dreams Makeover – In Ireland, we followed the success of a 2009 U.S. initiative with a competition to renovate playing fields for children who participate in sports through community clubs and schools. The winning club received a playing field make- over worth $175,000; three runners-up shared about $54,000 worth of professional grounds keeping. More than 500 clubs from across Ireland entered the competition.

TED WAY’S “SPIRIT OF AMERICA” AWARD

early 2010, Kellogg was selected for the United Way Worldwide’s highest national or—the “Spirit of America” award—for our company’s philanthropic contributions the U.S. and internationally. The prestigious award, which is given to one company     host of criteria, including corporate commitment to improving lives in local communities. ually, recognizes our comprehensive commitment to strengthening our communi- s in corporate philanthropy, community investment and volunteerism.

ween 2006 and 2010, Kellogg donated $64 million in cash and $122 million in food ducts to various nonprofit organizations. This included our unprecedented 2009 ation of an entire day’s worth of cereal production—approximately 55 million serv- s of cereal—to Feeding America. In addition to our food donations, United Way o commended our contributions toward the revitalization of downtown Battle Creek.

DISASTER RELIEF In 2010 and early 2011, Kellogg responded to a number of natural disaster relief efforts with product donations and cash contributions. Many of our relief efforts centered around earth- quakes, with our largest contributions for Japan and Haiti. In March 2011, we announced a $500,000 donation to the American Red Cross to support disaster relief efforts in Japan following the massive earthquake and tsunami. The contribu- tion included equal amounts of cash and product to support the efforts of the Japanese Red Cross Society.
have supported United Way for many years through corporate contributions and lar-for-dollar matches of employee and retiree pledges. Our U.S. 2010 campaign al was $6.7 million —up from $5.9 million in 2009—with 1,800 employees participat- in “Days of Caring” service projects in their communities, such as building homes, ving meals at shelters and distributing food to families.
FLOODING IN KENTUCKY In July 2010—for the second year in a row—floods ravaged the U.S. community of Pikeville, Ky., where we have a production facility. We responded with financial support and product donations to assist our employees and their neighbors who were impacted by flooding. All Pikeville plant employees and families were safe, although several suffered extensive damage to their homes. Kellogg helped to arrange safe lodging for displaced workers and their families. Kellogg’s Corporate Citizenship Fund contributed $15,000 to the local American Red Cross chapter to support flood relief efforts in eastern Kentucky. We also provided three pallet loads of products to local emergency shelters.

The previous year, Kellogg, along with our employees and re- tirees, provided nearly $400,000 to the American Red Cross to benefit Haiti, following the devastating earthquake there in January 2010. Much of this was from Kellogg’s Corporate Citi- zenship Fund; the remainder was from employee and retiree gifts that were matched with company donations. Before that earthquake struck, Kellogg had partnered with the international relief organization Food for the Poor for humani- tarian relief efforts. When the disaster hit, we already had prod-   out such partnerships in all of our global markets. ucts in place and a partner to assist with additional donations. In March 2010, we announced a $100,000 grant to support relief efforts in Chile, which suffered an 8.8 magnitude earth- quake on February 27, followed by hundreds of aftershocks. One month later, we contributed $25,000 following a signifi- cant earthquake in Mexicali, Mexico, where we have a manu- facturing plant. CHALLENGES WE FACE

We will continue to look for additional partners that can bring local knowledge and expertise to our efforts.

How does a company measure its community impacts? That’s a difficult question that we continue to evaluate. We want to make sure that the dollars we contribute are dollars well spent—and that they are meeting their intended objectives. We are always looking for better ways to evaluate the pro- grams we sponsor and to assess the best uses for our chari- table contributions. In challenging economic times, when global needs are greater than ever, we want to make sure we are maximizing our impact.
FLOODING IN AUSTRALIA Heavy flooding in early 2011 devastated parts of eastern Australia. Kellogg donated $250,000 and about 500,000 servings of cereal and snack foods to food banks in the Queensland region.
