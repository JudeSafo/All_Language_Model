Food safety is on the minds of many con- sumers. What does Kellogg see as the most pressing concern with food safety? A: David Mackay Food safety is, and has always been, our number-one priority. We are advocating for changes to the food safety regulatory system in the United States. Much like the European Union did almost a decade ago, U.S. stakehold- ers must prioritize and emphasize the impor- tance of prevention in ensuring food safety. Q. What is Kellogg doing to address global challenges like obesity? A: David Mackay We believe in the concept of energy balance— balancing the calories consumed as part of a healthy diet with the calories expended by physical activity. At Kellogg, we have been work- ing to help consumers balance both sides of the equation for some time. In Europe, for exam- ple, we have been involved with the European Commission’s Platform for Action on Diet, Physical Activity and Health. Last year in the 4

2009 Corporate Responsibility Report—Executive Summary 9

Nutrition and Health At Kellogg, we believe our role is to give con- sumers the information they need to make informed dietary choices for both themselves and their families. We also believe that all foods can have a place in the diet—with balance and moderation. These concepts are core to our Global Nutrition Policy, which we updated this year to take into account consumer nutrition needs in addition to available science. We are committed to reviewing this policy annually and to providing nutrition information in a transpar- ent and open manner. The Importance of Fiber In 2009, we zeroed in on an important nutrient, announcing plans to add fiber to many of our ready- to-eat cereals in the U.S. and Canada. By the end of 2010, we expect that the majority of our ready- to-eat cereals in the U.S. will qualify as “good”—if not “excellent”—sources of fiber.1 We believe Kellogg can have a big—and posi- tive—impact on consumer health by improving the nutritional content of cereals that are already popular with consumers. Since we haven’t changed the taste, we know these cereals will continue to be enjoyed. Only now, consumers will enjoy them with added nutritional benefits. The Challenge of Sodium One of the most challenging nutrition issues for Kellogg and other food manufacturers is find- ing ways to reduce the sodium in our foods while maintaining great taste. Over time, we have

Product Quality and Food Safety The quality and safety of our foods is our high- est priority. Kellogg has extensive systems and processes in place to ensure that our products meet our strict food safety standards. But managing a global supply chain of more than 1,500 products can be a challenge at times, as evidenced most recently by the 2009 recall of many products containing peanut ingredients in the U.S.— the largest recall in the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s history. Kellogg was one of many food companies adversely impacted by the recall of various peanut ingredients from the supplier Peanut Corporation of America. In the wake of this unfortunate situation, we took several immediate steps, including establishing new cross-functional Kellogg audit teams to audit suppliers of high-risk ingredients. We also stepped up the monitoring, testing and visibility of our raw material ingredients as part of a broader effort to reduce the number of strategic suppliers. In addition, we established a Food Safety Advisory Council comprised of external experts in toxicol- ogy, food science, regulatory, microbiology, legal and supply chain. The council is charged with sup- porting food safety intelligence and risk assess- ments, while providing strategic thinking on future food safety initiatives. Kellogg has long believed that prevention is the key to food safety, so that potential sources of contamination are identified and properly addressed before they become actual food safety problems. We have been strongly advocating for changes to the U.S. domestic food safety system. 12

We want to ensure we offer consum- ers the best products—including better-for-you and more indulgent choices. Through our foods, we want to continue to bring health, nutrition and enjoyment to people all over the world.




At Kellogg, our workplace initiatives are guided by our K Values™, including the value that urges us to “act with integrity and show respect.” We do this by adhering to high ethical standards, and by investing in our people and nurturing their development as leaders, by maintaining a diverse and inclusive work force, and by continually working to promote the safety, health and wellness of our employees.


INCE OUR LAST REPORT ince our last corporate responsibility report, we have begun to identify and define key performance indicators for our workplace issues, which ill help us to better gauge our progress. We’ve launched a new human resource initiative, myHR, which involves multiple technology solutions nd will help us to better track workplace-related measures such as employee demographics and turnover rates. This initiative was introduced n the U.S., Canada and Latin America in late 2009. Implementation planning for our Europe and Asia Pacific regions is underway.

lso in the past year and a half, we have developed two new training and development curricula, one for our most senior executives and one or individuals in the pipeline for those senior roles; begun assessing employees’ diversity and inclusion behaviors in the yearly performance eview process; and strengthened incentives for participating in our Feeling Gr-r-reat™ health and wellness program, among other activities.

Governance and Ethics Our company is governed by a 12-member Board of Directors. Ten of the Board members are independent of the company, as defined by the New York Stock Exchange. The Board operates through six committees—Audit, Compensation, Executive, Consumer Marketing, Nominating and Governance, and Social Responsibility—and according to a set of Corporate Governance Guidelines. All of the members of Board commit- tees are independent. A Global Code of ethics guides the business practices of all Kellogg employees worldwide. substantially all employees with access to company computers complete Kellogg Company’s annual Compliance and ethics training, which is conducted in 13 languages. during 2009, 16,931 employees (or about 55 percent of our global work force) received the training, totaling more than 30,000 hours. We have both a hotline, called the ethics Alert line, and a Web-based reporting tool for our employees, so they can raise questions or concerns anonymously.

The overall diversity of our U.S. work force also remains a focus. And, because diversity means different things in different locations around the world, we are working with company leaders at our international locations to understand how best to drive diversity and inclusion outside of our U.S. operations. Rising health care costs also present a financial challenge for us—as they do for every large U.S.-headquartered company. One way we are addressing this challenge is through our health and wellness programs, which encourage healthy behaviors and preventative care. 16

As a food company, we at Kellogg know that ensuring an adequate supply of food for the world’s growing population will require the efficient use of increasingly scarce natural resources. In fact, our business depends on sustainable supplies of water, energy and agricultural crops. We are committed to reducing our company’s impact on the environment and working with others to find solutions to global food challenges.


INCE OUR LAST REPORT ver the past year and a half, we have undertaken numerous initiatives at our facilities around the globe to reduce energy use, carbon dioxide (CO2) missions, water use and waste, and have made good progress toward our goals. As discussed in this section, in late 2009 we decided to hange our waste goal to focus on the aspect of waste that has the most significant environmental impact—that of waste sent to landfill. Also n 2009, we conducted environmental footprint assessments to understand CO2 emissions and water use over the lifecycle of selected Kellogg roducts; engaged with 67 of our largest suppliers on environmental impact reduction issues, including energy use and CO2 emissions; opened state-of-the-art plant in Mexico that features many energy- and water-saving technologies; and initiated several internal endeavors and exter- al partnerships to promote sustainable agriculture, among other activities.

mental sustainability practices into every aspect of our business. We are currently piloting a new environmental and safety management system at 12 Kellogg sites around the world. The system is designed to facilitate audit and compliance management, as well as incident management and reporting, relating to all of Kellogg Company’s environmental and occupational health and safety programs. The system is fully aligned with ISO 14001 and 18001. We expect to roll it out glob- ally in 2010. Energy Use and CO2 Emissions We consider energy use and CO2 emissions to be our most significant direct environmental impacts.2 They also represent a significant supply chain impact for Kellogg. Our recent carbon footprint assessments revealed that more than half of our products’ lifecycle carbon emissions can be attributed to the ingredients that go into making them. Kellogg has made strides in engaging with our suppliers on the issues of energy use and CO2 emissions. The Carbon Disclosure Project sent KELLOGG GLOBAL MANUFACTURING

Waste In 2009, we changed our waste goal to focus squarely on waste sent to landfill. It’s the aspect of waste that is of most interest to us and of most environmental concern, and for which we have the most accurate historical data. Previously, our goal was a 15 to 20 percent reduction in all forms of waste, per metric tonne of food produced, by 2015, using 2005 as a baseline. Our new goal is to further reduce waste sent to landfill by an additional 20 percent (per metric tonne of food produced) by 2015, using 2009 as a baseline. We’ve established this new target from a 2009 baseline because, as seen in the figure on p. 18, we have already made significant progress in reducing waste sent to landfill.5 In fact, we’ve decreased total waste sent to landfill by 36.3 per- cent since 2005, which equates to a 41.5 percent reduction per metric tonne of food produced.

Comments on Kellogg COMPANY’S Donation of a Day’s Worth of Cereal Production to Feeding America


Designed by Curran & Connors, Inc. / www.curran-connors.com
“As someone relatively new to Kellogg, I had heard a lot about the leadership Kellogg has always shown to provide for




people in need. When I was asked to help deliver this effort, I had no idea that I would be participating with a group of professionals that were so committed to doing all they could to get food to those in need. The heartfelt energy around the Feeding America donation was infectious. I’m proud to be a part of this company.” Daniel T., Senior VP, Customer Logistics Services, Kellogg Company 3

“I wanted to send the Kellogg Company a note of thanks for your ‘ day of production.’ The role modeling Kellogg is playing within the food industry will have great influence and consequence. We have talked for years about just such a program and have hoped and prayed that a very significant and well-respected company like Kellogg would one day set the example. Our hope is that it will be emulated by others around the world.” Bill Bolling, Founder & Executive Director, Atlanta Community Food Bank
