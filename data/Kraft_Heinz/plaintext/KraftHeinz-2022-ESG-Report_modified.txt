A LETTER FROM THE CEO Anyone who knows me well knows how passionate I am about good food and cooking. For me, both are all about relationships. Preparing a meal and creating special moments with those I cook for are among my favorite things. That’s why, as the CEO and Board Chair for a global food company with a delicious heritage, the work I do is so personal. I’m incredibly proud that our employees work each day to bring special moments to life for people across the globe. We at Kraft Heinz help feed the world through products that line store shelves and make their way to countless kitchens and restaurants. It all comes Together at the Table. One of our Company Values is We do the right thing, and everything we do grows from there. But we can only drive progress and achieve our Environmental Social Governance goals by collaborating across our Company and with external stakeholders. In fact, our 2022 ESG Report is a testament to the power of partnerships. There is a saying that I love: “If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together.” The concept of partnership and teamwork is essential – especially when it comes to our ESG efforts. Within this Report, we’re proud to share the progress we are making when it comes to achieving our strategic ESG priorities – thanks in large measure to the alliances we’ve built. It’s all about bringing these internal and external groups together at the Kraft Heinz table. That means our customers and suppliers, nonprofit partners, and importantly, our dedicated employees across the globe. That is what Together at the Table is all about. At Kraft Heinz, we take a cross-functional approach to ESG, integrating socially responsible and sustainable practices throughout our business and value chain as we work to deliver on our goals by the year 2025. For us, ESG is not a nice-to-do; it is important to how we operate as a company and to the success of our long-term business strategy. Our ESG goals and priorities fall under three broad Pillars: Healthy Living & Community Support, Environmental Stewardship, and Responsible Sourcing. We believe in focusing on high-priority issues in areas that matter most – and where we as a company can make the greatest impact. When it comes to ESG, we are on a long journey. While we celebrate the progress we are making toward our goals and Aspirations, we humbly acknowledge we have much work still to do. But despite these challenges, our teams have remained agile. They are working together to make real progress across our key metrics. And they are doing it all while prioritizing a more diverse and inclusive workplace. This annual Report serves as our Communication on Progress as part of our commitments to the United Nations Global Compact and CEO Water Mandate. I encourage you to visit our ESG website, where you’ll find more about our ESG progress and highlights of our achievements, goals, and Aspirations. I invite ALL of you to join us –to come Together at the Table – as we continue this journey of transforming our world for the better. There is room for all of us!

ESG Materiality Assessment To inform our ESG strategy and goal-setting, Kraft Heinz conducts a comprehensive ESG materiality assessment every three to five years, with respective smaller interim updates as appropriate. This assessment allows us to identify and prioritize the environmental, social and governance issues that are of greatest concern to our stakeholders and relevant to the success of our business. We reevaluate these results on an ongoing basis to reflect any substantial changes in standing on these priority issues and allow for the inclusion of new or emerging issues. We treat our ESG materiality matrix as a living assessment based on participant input. We continue to evaluate material ESG issues to our key stakeholders and the respective impact on our business operations across dynamic global markets. Material issues are monitored regularly by a variety of internal stakeholders including Kraft Heinz leadership, ESG and the Corporate and Government Affairs ESG Subcommittee.

In 2022, we updated our ESG materiality assessment using Datamaran’s cloud-based AI software platform. Datamaran’s patented technology provides our ESG Steering Committee with real-time data analysis to identify and monitor new or emerging issues that may impact Kraft Heinz, including regular insight into our Company’s unique strategic, regulatory, and reputational risks and opportunities. The assessment includes signals from across a variety of different sources, including corporate annual filings, mandatory regulations, voluntary policy initiatives, online news and media, as well as a cross-functional employee survey. Through this tech-enabled, dynamic and data-driven approach, we have strengthened our strategy and governance process to meet the rise of stakeholder demands at Kraft Heinz.

Enterprise Risk Management Kraft Heinz has an established, comprehensive approach to Enterprise Risk Management (ERM). Annually, senior management evaluates changes and required updates to the top enterprise risks. The ERM process covers a broad spectrum of risks across several dimensions: ESG, strategic, financial, operational, legal and regulatory, human capital, and hazard/catastrophic. Senior management prioritizes the risks and develops the Kraft Heinz risk profile, which is shared with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors annually. Each risk owner provides regular updates to the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.

Ethics & Compliance Employee Code of Conduct The Kraft Heinz Company and our employees are expected to conduct business in an ethical manner, guided by our Vision, Values and an unwavering commitment to integrity and transparency.

The global Code of Conduct sets high standards for conducting business in a legal and ethical manner and serves as the foundation of our corporate policies and procedures. To ensure compliance with the global Code of Conduct’s tenets, Kraft Heinz regularly provides training, communications, and guidance to our employees around the world. Further, employees are required to annually certify that they have read and will follow the global Code of Conduct. The document is available in 14 languages and can be accessed here: Kraft Heinz global Employee Code of Conduct.

Public Disclosure Kraft Heinz believes that an important aspect of engaging in the political process is transparency and disclosure. Kraft Heinz files information as required by federal and state campaign finance and disclosure laws. The Kraft Heinz PAC reports its contributions to the Federal Election Commission (FEC), the details of which are publicly available on the FEC internet site. All Kraft Heinz PAC and Company political contributions since 2012 are listed on our website. This includes contributions to ballot initiatives and 501(c) (4) organizations where funds may be utilized for political purposes. This information is updated semi-annually. In addition, Kraft Heinz partners with outside counsel to conduct an annual internal audit of all lobbying practices and reporting.


Lobbying Activity Kraft Heinz prepares and files reports with the Secretary of the U.S. Senate and the Clerk of the U.S. House of Representatives quarterly, which detail lobbying activities and expenditures. These reports are available here. The Company also files lobbying reports with many U.S. state and municipal governments as required by law. These reports are publicly available through the websites of the jurisdictions where they are filed.


Trade Association Membership Kraft Heinz believes that trade association membership and participation provides a number of benefits to our business and employees, including the ability to remain engaged on relevant issues and as a forum for sharing ideas and information. The Company’s involvement with trade associations does not include engaging in political activity. Kraft Heinz instructs trade associations that our dues must only be used on issues of importance to our business and none may be provided to support or oppose political candidates. Find language sent to trade associations here.


Center for Political Accountability Kraft Heinz has proudly doubled its score since 2015 on the “CPA-Zicklin Index,” a rating developed by the Center for Political Accountability in conjunction with the Carol and Lawrence Zicklin Center for Business Ethics Research at The Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania.

Annual Day of Service June 18, 2021, marked our second annual Kraft Heinz Day of Service – now a part of our annual calendar. The Day of Service commemorated and honored the importance of the Juneteenth holiday, providing opportunities for employees to participate in virtual and in-person service and educational events. In Canada, we hosted an Indigenous Day of Learning to honor the first National Day for Truth and Reconciliation.

In the US, our Business Resource Groups (BRGs) partnered with some of our biggest brands, Kraft Mac & Cheese, Heinz, and Oscar Mayer, raising over $100,000 to donate to the community organization of their choice. Specifically, we celebrated Pride by raising $34,000 for the Brave Space Alliance, a Black- and Trans-led non-profit on the south side of Chicago dedicated to helping and serving the LGBTQ+ community. The Sabor BRG supported Delimex in raising $8,000 on a fundraising campaign to benefit Heifer International, which allows women and youth farmers in Mexico to have access to education focused on entrepreneurial skills related to selling cage-free eggs, coffee, and honey. In addition, the Black BRG ran a United Negro College Fund (UNCF) campaign raising over $58,000. Recruiting We remain committed to strengthening our partnerships with organizations that support diversity recruitment. The Kraft Heinz Talent Attraction Team reviewed its partnerships in 2021 to ensure that each alliance was focused to support our goal of hiring talent from diverse backgrounds. Some examples include: Lime Connect: The largest network of high-potential university students and professionals – including veterans – who have disabilities in the world. Lime Connect also provided Kraft Heinz people managers with training about creating inclusive team environments for employees with disabilities. National Urban League: An organization committed to finding meaningful employment for underserved Americans. Lutheran Social Services: Supporting refugee resettlement by connecting newcomers to employment opportunities at Kraft Heinz plants close to refugee centers. Wounded Warriors Project: Hosted a hiring event for veterans at our Jacksonville plant.

In September 2019, we launched the #LearnLikeAnOwner Challenge to the entire company and invited employees to join leadership in this movement to encourage a culture of continuous learning, bold creativity, and intellectual curiosity. The movement is truly global as anyone can learn anywhere and at any time.

Employees not only #MakeTimeForLearning, they also share what they learn with other employees through a Kraft Heinz internal communications platform called KetchApp. Employee participation in the #LearnLikeAnOwner Challenge continued to grow in 2021, with over 1,300 employees making a commitment and logging approximately 36,000 hours of learning. Since Ownerversity’s inception in 2016, the global and zone learning teams have expanded the Kraft Heinz library to include custom Kraft Heinz learning experiences and curated playlists to help employees find training more easily. In 2020, there were over 479,500 registrations in the Ownerversity platform. The overall Ownerversity usage was 14 average learning hours per employee (both office professionals and production workers). These numbers increased further in 2021, with 537,938 registrations accounting for a total of 14.4 average learning hours per employee. The most attended programs across all Kraft Heinz were our #LearnLikeAnOwner Speaker Series followed by Ownerversity Day, our 24-hour event designed to bring the entire Kraft Heinz family together around learning. Google Analytics has shown the Ownerversity platform draws a sizable number of visitors year over year, with totals from 2019 and 2020 being fairly consistent (45,151 and 43,494 visitors respectively), and 2021 showing a significant increase (57,781 visitors).

Kraft Heinz employees from all corners of the world have passionately joined the Foundation through volunteer efforts towards our goals, highlighting the critical nature and immediacy of our work in helping to alleviate world hunger. We are proud that we achieved our original goal to provide 1 billion nutritious meals to those in need by 2021. At the end of 2021, through a combination of financial support and product donations, we have provided nearly 1.2 billion meals to those in need since 2016. In 2021 alone, we provided approximately 440 million meals to people in need – From 2019 through 2021, we’re now more than halfway to our 2025 goal of providing 1.5 billion meals to those in need.
PROGRESS         ON TRACK: 52%

The Kraft Heinz Micronutrient Campaign The Kraft Heinz Micronutrient Campaign, established by the H. J. Heinz Company in 2001, aims to use the skills and compassion of our employees to provide a nutritional supplement to promote healthy growth and development of those in hunger in developing regions around the world.

Understanding that nutrition and food are pivotal in the growth and success of a child, and especially significant for malnourished children across the globe, Kraft Heinz developed this micronutrient sachet with essential vitamins and minerals, to be mixed in with more readily available food without all these benefits.

Pandemic Relief in Indonesia During Indonesia’s COVID-19 lockdowns in 2021, many Indonesian families struggled to get the food and nutrition that they needed. Rise Against Hunger’s Malaysia office, along with partner HOPE Worldwide Indonesia, designed and distributed shelf-stable food boxes that included rice, mung beans, oil, flour and sugar to ensure that families continued to receive adequate sustenance during this time. The initiative reached seven major cities across Java, Indonesia’s most populous island, benefitting over 16,700 individuals.

Making high-quality products requires that we begin with high-quality ingredients of which fresh quality water is a key input. Kraft Heinz is committed to water stewardship in each aspect of our business, from our quality controls to the relationships we have with our growers and suppliers. As a food and beverage company, having access to sufficient amounts of quality fresh water, both now and in the future, is critical to our business. Water is used in many areas of our value chain. It is a vital input for growing various agricultural ingredients we use in our products. We also use water as a direct ingredient in many of our products and as a key utility in our manufacturing, cleaning and sanitation processes. Access to high quality water is pivotal for us to achieve our high standards of food safety and quality. High-quality water will continue to be a vital component throughout our value chain.

In addition, Ecolab and Kraft Heinz are working closely to conduct Total Plant Assessment (TPA) audits. These TPA audits provide a holistic, end-to-end review of a Kraft Heinz facility’s water and energy use, followed by recommendations for mitigation. This enables Ecolab and Kraft Heinz to continuously identify and drive operational and environmental improvement projects. Four TPAs were conducted in 2021 at Kraft Heinz manufacturing sites. As a result of these projects Kraft Heinz was able to save 193 thousand cubic meters of water, 410 megawatts of electricity and 170 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent.

Water Risk Assessment In early 2018, we completed a water risk assessment of our global manufacturing operations. This work was completed by Antea Group, a leading global sustainability consulting firm and provider of water resource expertise to the food and beverage sector who is also certified by CDP. The assessment leveraged both WRI’s (World Resources Institute) Aqueduct data and methodology along with the subject matter expertise of our consulting partner. We then evaluated our watershed conditions from a business perspective in order to validate economic scarcity factors not fully addressed by the database indicators. The completed assessment resulted in identification of physical, reputational/ social and quality water risks, as well as composite scores for each area associated in our direct manufacturing operations. In 2020, we updated our water risk assessment . Of the total 81 sites that we operated in, we completed a watershed risk assessment of 79 sites. Water use from these 79 sites derived from 66 percent municipal, 25 percent bore and nine percent surface.

After an internal expert committee evaluation, it was determined that 19 of the 79 sites evaluated had some degree of elevated water stress. In addition to our water reduction targets, we have also developed a plan that focuses on these high-risk water areas to drive improvements and mitigate risks, and to provide updates into our risk evaluation on an ongoing basis. Moreover, we will evaluate any interim mitigation strategies as needed.

Energy Use & Conservation Reduce energy use intensity by 15% across our manufacturing facilities by 2025 (per metric ton of product made). PROGRESS PROGRESS                 ON TRACK: — 5.1%


Manufacturing our products to finished packaged goods and maintaining our highest standards around safety, quality, and sanitation, all while providing a comfortable and secure environment for our employees to work, can consume significant amounts of energy. In this type of interdependent environment, we know many opportunities exist to reduce energy consumption through operational optimization. We are on a journey of continuous improvement to identify our opportunities in this area and capitalize on them.

As a leading global food and beverage company, our scale provides a unique ability to test concepts at various sites, learn from ourselves, prove outcomes, and then implement successful energy savings initiatives across our business.

Our Kraft Heinz manufacturing facilities across the globe have been undergoing a significant digital transformation to improve the tracking and efficiency of our energy and other utility usage onsite. For example, in 2021 our Kirksville facility in the U.S. conducted a steam trap digital monitoring pilot to improve energy efficiency by better detecting any steam track failures, which are commonplace at the site. The new digital, infra-red system solution helped technicians spot steam failures early and                                 Energy Goal Progress better utilize their time on other critical plant needs instead of manually troubleshooting any failures. The pilot successfully improved energy efficacy and the Company is looking to expand this pilot to other high-use steam facilities.


Another key example of our energy saving initiatives is at our Cairo facility. Approximately 24 percent of the facility’s electricity consumption comes from its compressed air usage. Teams on the ground worked to implement an air compressor scorecard to monitor energy consumption and also built better monitoring devices. Over the course of 2021, the facility was able to save approximately 15 percent of overall electricity consumption.                                                   We aim to decrease energy use intensity by 15 percent by 2025. In 2021, we reduced energy use intensity by 5.1 percent as compared to our 2019 baseline.

Decarbonizing our Operations at Kitt Green U.K. In 2021, we signed a Memorandum of Understanding with HyNet, a leading decarbonization project in the U.K., that will supply low carbon hydrogen to fuel our Kitt Green facility. Kitt Green is one of Europe’s largest food processing facilities, producing more than 1 billion cans of food per year. Switching to low carbon hydrogen is a critical piece of the Net Zero puzzle and will enable a switch away from fossil fuels starting in 2025. From 2025, HyNet and North Wales will produce, store and distribute low carbon hydrogen, as well as capture and safely store carbon dioxide (CO2).

Waste Reduction
ade). .7%



At Kraft Heinz, we think about waste holistically. To source, produce and package food and beverage products requires several inputs and outputs related to ingredients and byproducts, material flows and end-of-life packaging considerations. When we think about materials and food-related flows, detailed waste evaluations help us identify where we can ‘prevent, reduce, repurpose and recycle.’ In fact, our global owned manufacturing sites divert more than 90 percent of our solid waste to recycling or byproducts usage.

In 2021, five new Kraft Heinz manufacturing facilities achieved zero waste-to-landfill status, bringing our total to 16 facilities across the world. These new sites include Shanghai (China), Kaiping (China), Pudliszki (Poland), Yangjiang (China), Pasuruan (Indonesia) and Wagga Wagga (Australia).
Diverting Waste at Guadalajara Our facility in Guadalajara, Mexico embarked on a series of projects to divert waste from being sent to the landfill. The site primarily achieved this by sending any leftover packaging to undergo pyrolysis. This process allows for any unsaleable product to be treated and turned into fuel, increasing the circularity of our waste. The site also began a program to divert sludge waste destined for the landfill to be utilized for composting. In total, the We aim to decrease waste to landfill intensity by 20 percent iacross our manufacturing facilities by 2025.

In Italy, our Plasmon brand launched a fully recyclable baby food pouch in partnership with Gualapack, a leading Italian company specialized in high-performance pouch packaging. The 100 percent fruit snack designed to be good for children, is now also good for the environment. The pouch is designed to be easily recycled in its respective recycling stream, certified by independent institutes HTP Cyclos and Interseroh Dienstleistungs GmbH. This means that after use, pouches can be collected and turned into new non- food products within a Circular Economy framework. Through this initiative, Plasmon successfully reached 97 percent fully recyclable packaging for its Italian market. Annually, we estimate giving new life to over 270 tons of plastic, which will become new containers, caps, textile fibers, components for cars and household appliances, laboratory equipment and much more. Kraft Heinz also became a member and supporting partner of the Composting Consortium. Managed by the Center for the Circular Economy at Closed Loop Partners, the Composting Consortium is a multi-year collaboration across the entire compostable packaging value chain to pilot industry-wide solutions and build a roadmap for investment in technologies and infrastructure that enable the recovery of compostable food packaging and food scraps.

The baseline risk assessment of our direct global palm oil supply chain conducted in 2017 allowed us to identify potential deforestation risks, as well as peatland/biodiversity hotspot encroachment concerns. Direct suppliers were additionally asked to provide information on the country of origin of their palm raw materials, as well as their sustainable/ responsible sourcing policies. Details on their sustainable palm oil objectives and progress were also shared. Suppliers were also asked to provide traceability data for all palm oil mills in their supply chain. The mills’ geographical location in conjunction with a global satellite mapping tool incorporated potential deforestation and other environmentally related risks in the mill sourcing regions. The information obtained from this exercise informed our Global Sustainable Palm Oil Policy, and allowed us to engage our suppliers to discuss any identified risks and develop action plans to manage them.

Kraft Heinz believes that good animal welfare includes three elements which guide our animal welfare policies and initiatives:                                                                        Source 100% of eggs in Europe from free-range hens by 2020. • Health and Productivity: healthy animals that are provided with                                                                                   PROGRESS                  COMPLETE: 100% quality shelter, feed, and water • Emotional Well-Being: negative experiences minimized and positive experiences enhanced                                                                                              Improve broiler chicken welfare in the U.S. by 2024 • Naturalness: animals perform important species-specific behaviors                                                          and European chicken commitment by 2026.

Examples include, but are not limited to, cage- free housing with perches and nest boxes for laying hens and group housing for gestating sows. When painful procedures need to be performed, we encourage pain mitigation, such as the use of anesthetics or analgesics. Kraft Heinz expects its suppliers to implement practices and pursue continuous improvement consistent with the Five Freedoms and good animal welfare.

A Culture of Animal Welfare (cont.)


Public interest in farming and animal care is increasing and consumers desire farming practices that match their values and expectations. Good animal welfare, environmental sustainability, and healthy people form an interconnected system; and well managed farms reduce waste and provide a safe, nutritious food supply. Knowing this, we integrate science and societal ethics in our animal welfare decisions. In 2021, we released our updated Global Animal Welfare Policy and our inaugural Supplier Implementation Guide which are available on our Supplier Hub. Animal Welfare Outreach and Education In 2021, we worked with Dr. Kurt Vogel at the University of Wisconsin, River Falls to establish an undergraduate research internship program. The students in this program worked with academic and industry experts to develop supplier questionnaires on dairy calf management, broiler transport, and their swine welfare programs. Our animal welfare specialist partners with suppliers on animal welfare improvement projects, such as developing a customized turkey load-out and transport audit. They serve on the animal welfare committees of the North American Meat Institute and the National Turkey Federation. Within Kraft Heinz, our specialist provides training on farm animal production and welfare to cross-functional team members and leads our ESG Steering Group Subcommittee on Animal Welfare.

The ability to engage in normal behaviors such as walking, nesting, and dust-bathing is important to laying hen welfare. Therefore, by 2025 we are globally committed to purchasing only cage-free eggs or better. Kraft Heinz defines “cage-free or better” eggs as sourced from laying hens that come from cage-free, free-range, pasture-raised, or similar natural or open housing settings. Hens in both cage-free and free-range housing are provided with litter, perches and nest boxes. In 2021, 64 percent of the eggs and egg products* we purchased globally were cage-free or better.

In the U.S., 100 percent of our cage-free egg supply was certified by American Humane Certified or Certified Humane. In accordance with our three elements of animal welfare, we believe that pregnant sows should be safely housed in social groups with enough space to perform normal behaviors. The industry faces challenges to meet the demand, especially for pork that complies with strict regional legislation. Kraft Heinz is working with our pork suppliers to transition pregnant sows from gestation stall housing to group, pen housing. In 2021, 25 percent of our global and 98 percent of our European pork supply came from sows housed in pen gestation systems.

At Kraft Heinz, we have a long history of working with growers to promote sustainable agricultural practices, such as implementing rotational crops to promote multigenerational fields, to increase yield at the field and in processing, adoption of next generation breeding through our seed business, and finding ways to help increase water efficiency.

Through thorough research in our laboratories and with experienced agronomist teams on the ground, we strive to stay at the forefront of sustainable agriculture, applying what we learn through trialing and demonstration to additional parts of our business. The Kraft Heinz Sustainable Agriculture Practices Manual forms the foundation of our engagement strategy with growers, as we work towards our 2025 goal to source 100 percent of tomatoes for Heinz Tomato Ketchup sustainably. We aim to dig deep in our roots to use 150 years of forward-looking, responsible agricultural and human rights practices to build on our agricultural legacy with our farmers. We are committed to further building on our strong sustainability heritage, as Henry J. Heinz (founder of the H.J. Heinz Company) famously noted, “Protect the consumer by owning the product all the way from the soil to the table.”

Sustainable Agricultural Practices Manual Sustainable farming practices do more than save important natural resources. They also have the potential to considerably increase crop yields and provide growers and their families with greater economic opportunity. Kraft Heinz has taken significant steps to strengthen our Sustainable Agriculture Practices Manual (SAP) and is working in partnership with growers to implement those practices. In 2021, we launched our Sustainable Agricultural Practices Manual with suppliers and growers in both Spain and California, key growing regions for Heinz tomatoes. In the coming years, we plan to roll out audit programs to ensure supplier compliance with these standards and will be expanding the scope of our sustainable agricultural program to navy beans. Building the Regenerative Capacity of Agriculture Through a Global, Farmer-Centered, Industry-led Initiative. The long-term resilience of agriculture now depends on how quickly we can develop regenerative practices that benefit soil health, biodiversity, water supply, climate resilience and livelihoods. In late 2021, Kraft Heinz, along with approximately 30 companies from across the agricultural value chain, became a founding member of SAI Platform’s new Regenerative Agriculture Programme. The purpose of the program is to build industry alignment, reduce duplication and amplify impact through the creation of a universal framework with locally implementable indicators, to ensure accessibility and applicability of regenerative agriculture principles, practices and outcomes on farm. The program will work to scientifically validate regenerative principles, engage with farmers and develop a mechanism for corporations to verify and communicate regenerative targets to external stakeholders. “As we develop and define new regenerative agriculture approaches, it is the farmer’s inherent knowledge of the land, its constraints and opportunities, that is critical to ensuring successful social and environmental outcomes based on solid economic foundations.” – Martina Henry, Director, Agriculture Sustainability, Kraft Heinz and SAI Platform Regenerative Agriculture Programme Steering Committee Co-chair

FSA 3.0 Benchmark Equivalence for Sustainable Agriculture In 2021, our Sustainable Agricultural Practices Manual was benchmarked against SAI Platform’s Farm Sustainability Assessment (FSA) 3.0 and received ‘Silver Level equivalence’. This was the first sustainability program successfully benchmarked against the updated FSA 3.0 which was released in April 2021. We believe this benchmark will help us and our suppliers in our journey towards purchasing 100 percent sustainably-sourced Heinz ketchup tomatoes by 2025. It provides a pathway for growers to demonstrate “FSA 3.0 marks a step-up in the benchmarking program’s integrity, yet it is even more straightforward and easier to get started. It is great to see refine, communicate and scale their program. We congratulate them on

Celebrating the Tomato with the Community at our Pudliszki Facility Our Pudliszki, Poland facility revived its annual Grower Open Day in 2021, having pivoted to an online format at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. This event brought together 500 growers and their families from across the region, along with other industry stakeholders. The event showcased the results of large-scale variety trials of both Heinz and non-Heinz seeds, to share industry best-practices through demonstrations and field trials. Grower Open Day also included a presentation of best-in-class agricultural practices through its celebration of the tomato, with community competitions for best tomato fruits and tomato-based meals, firmly placing Pudliszki at the center of the local community. The Pudliszki facility was also separately recognised as the Best Processor in 2021 by BASF’s Nunhems® brand and the Polish Tomato Producer’s Association’s Agro Academy Awards. We received this award for our strong focus on innovation, large-scale tomato trials in Poland, close relationships with growers and for implementing better soil preparation practices to increase resilience during drought conditions. In addition, Elwira and Leszek Chudziak, tomato producers for our Pudliszki facility, won the award for most innovative grower based on their improvements to the nursery and farm operations. Elwira and Leszek’s farm was first started with the support of Kraft Heinz’s lead agronomist for Pudliszki, Slawomir Paszkier.

Supporting Farm Resilience in California As part of our ongoing commitment to continuous improvement on farm, in 2021 we introduced a pilot cover crop program with our California tomato growers. The objective of the pilot is to incentivize the adoption of cover crops as a practice that can help promote soil health, enhance water-holding capacity, reduce reliance on chemical inputs, and support biodiversity while increasing yields. In 2021, 2,279 acres of cover crops were planted by our California growers and we have a target to grow this to more than 5,000 acres in 2022.

Therefore, we are committed to bringing bold, innovative, and like-minded partners ’Together at the Table’ to help lead the way. Bowles Farming Company is a key global tomato supplier for many of our well-loved brands, including the iconic Heinz tomato ketchup. As a 160-year-old family-run farm, Bowles understands the importance of sustainable and regenerative agriculture. Their philosophy centers around stewardship and farming with the natural world in focus. Bowles is adjacent to the second largest contiguous wetland in the U.S. To help preserve this area of great biodiversity value, they own and manage 650 acres of wetland within their boundary and work with a wide range of stakeholders to maintain these lands. These initiatives include native plant cultivation to help pollinators and beneficial insects thrive around the farm. Recognizing a shortage

“From our vantage point here on the farm, we see the word “sustainability” widely used but not often backed up with strong evidence. We value collaborative relationships with supply chain partners that want to provide consumers with true stories of sustainable production that consumers can trust and feel good about. Kraft Heinz is one of those key partners who take the time to visit the farm and partner in our journey to produce products in a way that authentically supports people and the planet. We value our relationship with Kraft Heinz and admire their leadership in true sustainability.”

Bowles receives organic waste from their local communities that is then converted into certified organic compost. They use most of this compost on their farm, which improves soil quality and water retention, and reduces the amount of nitrogen fertilizer needed in its operations.
